  <h3>The Role of Systems Engineering in Developing Good Service Operations: A Case Study of Carvelas Wash</h3>

  <p>Systems engineering is a way of working founded on multiple disciplines that develop, combine, and manage complicated systems and their lifecycle. It was initiated in military and aerospace domains but now functions in many industries, including healthcare, transport, and small businesses.</p>

  <p>As the owner of Carvelas Wash, a car wash and mobile detailing service, I have found that systems engineering principles are highly valuable in developing service operations that are customer-focused, sustainable, and efficient. In this blog, we consider the ways in which systems engineering influences daily operations and business development plans for small businesses such as mine.</p>

  <h3>Understanding Systems Engineering</h3>

  <p>Systems engineering, in the words of Holt (2019), enables practitioners to describe problems, discern customer needs, and translate them into actionable requirements. The field emphasizes a step-by-step process: from concept to design, implementation, testing, and operation. Classical engineering that focuses on a single element (say, electrical or mechanical design) is distinct from systems engineering, where the system is viewed as an entirety—how each component interacts, integrates, and works harmoniously.</p>

  <p>A car is more than an engine. It has parts like brakes, wheels, and battery, and also executes software on navigation and diagnosis. Humans interact with it via the driver interface. Carvelas Wash is not about soap and water alone. It is made up of scheduling software, customer service processes, chemical management, equipment logistics, and mobile operations. Systems engineering renders this complicated system coherent and structured by facilitating adequate documentation, requirement analysis, stakeholder communication, and testing in phases (Holt, 2019).</p>

  <h3>Stakeholder-Centric Design of Service Systems</h3>

  <p>One of the key concepts in systems engineering is understanding the stakeholders. Stakeholders are customers, employees, suppliers, regulators, and even local community members who use or are impacted by the system. Every stakeholder has varying needs and constraints. For Carvelas Wash, key stakeholders are our customers (who desire on-time services, environmentally friendly services, and affordable ones), our employees (who desire proper tools, equitable schedules, and protection), and city regulators (who govern water usage and waste disposal).</p>

  <p>By recognizing stakeholder requirements upfront, systems engineering prevents design failures. For instance, we first employed scheduling spreadsheets but soon realized that customers needed real-time updates on bookings. Once we had mapped out the stakeholder requirements, we incorporated an online scheduling application with route optimization and achieved a 25% improvement in service efficiency.</p>

  <p>This is a good illustration of how system requirements are derived from analyzing stakeholders and verifying them repeatedly, not from assumptions. This is a best practice recommended in systems engineering textbooks (Blanchard & Fabrycky, 2010).</p>

  <h3>Accounting for Life Cycles in Small Businesses</h3>

  <p>Another basic principle of systems engineering is the life cycle model. The life cycle includes phases like concept development, design, implementation, testing, operation, maintenance, and retirement. In Carvelas Wash, we use this principle in our equipment, processes, and computer systems.</p>

  <p>We chose our pressure washers based on their price, frequency of servicing, effect on the environment, and lifespan. Comparison showed that investing in more powerful equipment from the beginning would lower the costs of owning it overall and reduce the duration it will be out of service—these principles apply well to systems engineering principles (Holt, 2019).</p>

  <p>We modeled our service flow to examine the entire life cycle. Once the customer books online, the system initiates a sequence: confirming the schedule → mapping the route → reviewing the pre-service checklist → obtaining feedback after the wash. This flow reflects a well-thought-out system that enhances both customer experience and team efficiency.</p>

  <h3>Managing Complexity by Modularity and Integration</h3>

  <p>Systems engineering encourages the use of modular systems. This is where we take large, complicated systems and split them into easier, manageable modules that are standalone yet still work together in harmony. We use modularity in several ways at Carvelas Wash. Our packages are modular, including Basic Wash, Premium Detail, and Eco-Foam Finish. We even have our tools divided into mobile kits for waterless wash, glass treatment, and tire treatment.</p>

  <p>Integration is involved when all must interface in the field. A good example is our scheduling system integrating with inventory tracking so we never run out of important supplies. This type of system integration eliminates errors, delays, and misunderstandings. It also takes the best practices from key fields, where complex systems—like an airplane—must integrate avionics, fuel systems, flight controls, and communications seamlessly (Sherugar & Budiu, 2016).</p>

  <h3>Iterative Design and Continuous Improvement</h3>

  <p>Systems engineering involves repeating steps: test → learn → improve. At Carvelas Wash, we often try new products, collect feedback from customers, and update our processes. One recent example was when we started using a biodegradable foam that left marks on windows. After getting complaints from customers and testing it, we switched to a better product. This change raised satisfaction scores by 18% in just one month.</p>

  <p>This feedback loop illustrates how systems engineering facilitates ongoing learning. We recorded the issue, diagnosed the cause, altered the subsystem, and reassessed performance—perfectly following the systems engineering V-model and risk-reduction approaches (Blanchard & Fabrycky, 2010).</p>

  <h3>Digital Systems and Humans Collaborating</h3>

  <p>Carvelas Wash relies heavily on digital tools such as online forms, route planning, receiving weather warnings, and real-time payment processing. Systems engineering trains us to consider not only the technology but how humans interact with it. As an example, we redesigned our booking form after noticing customers would abandon it partway through. By simplifying the layout and reducing the number of fields, completion rates went from 64% to 91%.</p>

  <p>This echoes ideas of human-centered design, which is often talked about in systems engineering when usability and system integration are involved. As Sherugar and Budiu (2016) explain, direct manipulation and easy-to-use interfaces minimize user frustration and build trust in the system.</p>

  <h3>Conclusion: Systems Thinking for Everyday Innovation</h3>

  <p>Systems engineering is not only for NASA—it is an effective methodology for anyone who is constructing or overseeing complex services, even mobile car wash businesses. By using its fundamental principles—stakeholder analysis, lifecycle thinking, modularity, integration, iterative improvement, and human-centered design—Carvelas Wash has developed a dependable, responsive, and scalable service system.</p>

  <p>Most of all, systems engineering gets the small businesses to think big. We are not just washing cars; we're engineering a sustainable system of service provision. Thinking this way, supported by systems thinking, we improve customer experience more, empower our people, and expand with confidence.</p>

    <title>How Systems Grow: Understanding the Life Cycle of a System</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>How Systems Grow: Understanding the Life Cycle of a System</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Everything we use today—phones, websites, cars, even smart homes—are systems. 
        But these systems don’t just appear. They are <strong>designed, built, used, fixed, and one day, replaced</strong>. 
        This process is called the <strong>systems development life cycle</strong>, or SDLC.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this post, we’ll explain what that life cycle means, the different ways to manage it 
        (called <strong>life cycle models</strong>), and why it’s important to think about a system’s life from beginning to end.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>What Is the Systems Development Life Cycle?</h2>
    <p>
        The <strong>systems development life cycle (SDLC)</strong> is a step-by-step way of creating and managing systems. 
        It helps engineers and teams stay organized and make sure the system works properly.
    </p>
    <p>
        According to <em>Systems Engineering Demystified</em>, a system usually goes through these <strong>six steps</strong>:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Conception</strong> – Think about the system's goal and why it is needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Development</strong> – Create ideas, test options, and choose the best design.</li>
        <li><strong>Production</strong> – Build the system and test it to make sure it works.</li>
        <li><strong>Utilization</strong> – The system is used by people or organizations.</li>
        <li><strong>Support</strong> – Fix problems, make updates, and help users.</li>
        <li><strong>Retirement</strong> – Stop using the system and remove it safely.</li>
    </ol>

    <hr>

    <h2>Life Cycle Models: Three Ways to Build a System</h2>
    <p>There are different ways to follow the life cycle. These are called <strong>Life Cycle Models</strong>. The three most common are:</p>

    <h3>1. Linear Model (Waterfall)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>You <strong>finish one step</strong> before going to the next.</li>
        <li>It’s simple and easy to understand.</li>
        <li>But if you make a mistake early, it's hard to fix later.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Good for:</strong> Small projects with clear goals.<br>
    <strong>Not good for:</strong> Projects where changes happen often.</p>

    <h3>2. Iterative Model</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>This model <strong>repeats the steps</strong> many times.</li>
        <li>Each time, the system gets better.</li>
        <li>You can test and improve as you go.</li>
        <li>But if you're not careful, it can go on too long.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Good for:</strong> Complex projects with changing ideas.<br>
    <strong>Not good for:</strong> Projects with a short deadline or fixed budget.</p>

    <h3>3. Incremental Model</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>This model <strong>adds features one at a time</strong>.</li>
        <li>You deliver small working parts early.</li>
        <li>Users can try the system as it grows.</li>
        <li>But putting all the parts together can be tricky.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Good for:</strong> Big projects that need fast results.<br>
    <strong>Not good for:</strong> Projects that must be done all at once.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>Why Does the Life Cycle Matter?</h2>
    <p>
        Thinking about the life cycle helps us:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Plan better</strong> – We know what to do at each step.</li>
        <li><strong>Build smarter</strong> – We focus only on what the system really needs.</li>
        <li><strong>Fix faster</strong> – It’s easier to update or repair the system.</li>
        <li><strong>Save money</strong> – We avoid big mistakes later.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        As the book says, it’s not just about building the system—it’s about 
        <strong>managing how the system changes over time</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Also, when systems are built with <strong>sustainability</strong> in mind, 
        we reduce waste and help the planet (Jovanovic et al., 2022).
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>
        No system lasts forever. It will change, grow, and one day stop working. 
        That’s why understanding the life cycle is so important. And by choosing the 
        <strong>right model</strong> (linear, iterative, or incremental), we can make sure 
        we design systems that <strong>last longer, work better, and meet real needs</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you work in tech, design, or management, learning about the systems life cycle 
        will help you make smarter choices—and better systems.
    </p>

<h1>What Makes Digital Systems Usable: An Examination of the Role of Memory, Habits, and Attentive Cognitive Design</h1> 
</header> 
<main> 
<section>
<p>Usability in digital systems is so much more than merely the visual appearance and feel of elements and interfaces. It implies that the system is not just easy but also intuitive, enabling users to readily grasp concepts and utilize the features without unnecessary complexity. Good and well-considered design matters in assisting individuals in getting their job done efficiently, while eliminating the feeling of confusion or stress along the way. Such a seamless experience happens when the system adopts the natural cognitive behaviors and memory processes that humans naturally engage in. Based on the fact that our brains inherently possess limitations with regard to information processing, it is incumbent upon good design to bear such limitations in mind, ensuring that it augments and assists users rather than working against them (Johnson, 2020).</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Memory, Mental Models, and Interaction</h2>
<p>Most of the time, individuals tend not to recall all the information they encounter in their lifetimes. In fact, our working memory capacity is rather limited and can only retain a finite amount of information at a given moment. This hinders people to aid the process of recognition of options rather than the process of recalling the options. For instance, it is mostly much simpler and easier to click on an option in the menu compared to trying to recall a particular command. This is precisely the reason why websites and applications have to put options and features in front of the users instead of behind them.</p>
<p>Another key and core concept to talk about is what is known as the "mental model." This particular term is used to define how individuals think and understand how a specific system operates or functions. When the system is functioning in a manner that is contrary to the expectations of the users, or what they are searching for, it creates confusion and ambiguity for the user. For instance, consider a case where an individual is accustomed to a "back" button that consistently brings them back to the previous page they were viewing. But if this same button were to bring them to the main page all of a sudden, they would definitely get confused and would be lost (Johnson, 2020). The concept of a mental model is key because it makes individuals gain a sense of control when interacting with the system. They are confident in the system when it behaves in the way they expect.</p>
<p>I used to have a printer program that made me choose the paper size and printer each time. I expected that it would recall them. Since it did not, I kept making mistakes. This shows how incompatibility of mental models and lack of memory support make systems harder to use.</p>

<section>
<h2>Consistency and Feedback: Foundations of Usability</h2>
<p>One of the most critical and basic usability guidelines that is most emphasized is the law of consistency. This particular principle is talking about the fact that it is essential to have the same look and feel throughout the entire system one is using. When elements such as buttons, icons, and labels all visually resemble one another and behave in the identical manner, individuals are able to learn and adapt much more quickly. For instance, when the "trash" icon always means one is deleting something, users can instantly understand what will occur when they decide to click on it (Krug, 2014).</p>
<p>Feedback is extremely crucial for any user interface. When the user performs some action on the system by clicking a button or doing something else, it is necessary for the system to respond. This helps them understand that their action has been executed successfully. Feedback can be given in various forms, such as the audible tone of sound, a visual change in color, or even a brief flash of text. For instance, after a user submits a form, showing a message of simply "Thank you" conveys the message to the user that the form has been submitted successfully. But without the feedback, the users may remain confused and can even attempt to try the same operation again in a hope to find the desired result.</p>
<p>This type of event has the ability to lead to all manner of errors, or even lead individuals to consider abandoning the use of the system altogether (Budiu, 2023).</p>

<section>
<h2>Cognitive Load and the Various Design Traps</h2>
<p>Cognitive load is the amount of mental effort that is needed for a person to be able to use a system effectively. As the cognitive demands go higher, it becomes much harder for the user to use the system in an efficient way. A good system is engineered in such a way that the cognitive load remains low. This means that users are not subjected to the necessity of having to think too much or keep too many bits of information in their heads at the same time (Johnson, 2020). To put this argument into perspective, if a certain system subjects users to five different kinds of menus to navigate through, it is possible that users will feel tired or frustrated within a short period of time because of too many options.</p>
<p>Poor design is a frequent complaint. I once used a shopping site where the discount field was at the top of the page, but the promo code input was at the bottom. I kept missing it. This frustrated me because I couldn't finalize my order effortlessly. Little glitches like this get users to believe that the system is broken when it isn't.</p>
<p>This specific issue has close relevance to the principle that goes by the name Tesler's Law. In accordance with Tesler, he advocated for the fact that any system does inherently contain some amount of complexity which is inherent. Note that it is not complexity which can be totally eradicated; it is something which can be moved or transferred, that's all. A good and well-constructed system is able to hide the more difficult and more complicated aspects from the user so that they experience it smoother. Designers have an important choice in front of them: whether they wish to take care of the complexity themselves or wish to pass the burden of it on to the end user. Ultimately, an optimally usable system assigns the responsibility and weight of handling that complexity on the designer's part, instead of leaving it to the user who is utilizing the system (Babich, 2023).</p>
<p>As explained in Chapter 9 of the Laws of UX, Tesler's Law is an important reminder to designers, emphasizing the requirement to curb the amount of cognitive load imposed on the user. This can be achieved quite effectively by taking proper care of complicated complexities in the background, thereby facilitating a better user experience. When this law is implemented successfully, users are able to experience an uninterrupted and smooth interaction, often without even being aware that the system is more than capable of performing a series of complex logical functions on their behalf (Babich, 2023).</p>

<h2>Takeaways from Designing with the Mind in Mind</h2>
<p>Jeff Johnson's book Designing with the Mind in Mind has plenty of great suggestions for ways to simplify digital systems to make them more usable. Two important points from Chapters 6–9 are:</p>
<ol>
<li>"People can't keep much in working memory." That is, a system must not ask users to remember steps or details from page to page. Keep everything in sight. Make actions clear (Johnson, 2020).</li>
<li>"People learn better by doing." This principle calls on designers to let users experiment. Explain through example. Keep it simple to reverse. In this way, users will be able to learn while in a state of comfort (Johnson, 2020).</li>
</ol>

<h3>Practical Uses in Everyday Life and Personal Insight</h3>
<p>Everyday digital tools demonstrate how usability is done—or isn't. Apple's iPhone, for instance, is commended for its uncluttered, consistent design. The buttons are where you always expect them to be, and gestures such as swipe and tap are reliable. This minimizes learning over and over (Norman, 2013).</p>
<p>On the other hand, government websites often feel confusing. Pages are long, options are hidden, and there's little feedback after submitting a form. This makes users feel nervous or lost. A form I filled out once didn't show if my data was saved. I had to re-enter it several times. That's an example of high cognitive load and poor usability.</p>
<p>Another example is the clear difference between large e-commerce behemoth Amazon and smaller e-commerce websites that exist. Amazon effectively guides the customer through their shopping process with concise instructions to perform, progress indicators that inform consumers of their status, and helpful suggestions that can enhance consumers' shopping process. Smaller sites often overlook or omit these essential functions, which can result in a checkout process that is more challenging and confusing for consumers to navigate.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion, making a digital system usable and user-friendly needs an understanding of how the human mind works. One should keep in mind that humans do not have a perfect or ideal memory. Instead, they prefer familiar things that they recognize, contrary to products or features that they must remember from their memory. Also, users expect to get feedback every time they take any type of action within the system. It is also vital to accept the fact that people may get stressed out when subjected to too much cognitive load or when too much thinking is needed to use the system.</p>
<p>Good systems play a crucial role in allowing individuals to be successful in what they are doing. They accomplish this by accurately mapping onto users' mental models, maintaining consistent layouts throughout the experience, offering beneficial feedback, and minimizing the overall effort required to utilize the system. Designers must keep Tesler's Law in mind, which states that all systems possess a certain degree of complexity inherent in them. The follow-up question that arises from this law is: who bears the brunt of this complexity—designers or users?</p>
<p>By adhering to fundamental cognitive principles and being mindful of how we design, we can create systems that not only function well but also feel supportive and effortless to use. This quality of being smooth and compliant is precisely what enables digital systems to be usable in the first place.</p>
