            <h3>What is System Engineering</h3>
            <p>Behind every concept there's a foundation that is brought to light by an idea. In this instance, I'll be going over system engineering's foundation and transition into present times definition. According to <i>Systems Engineering Demystified</i> , John Holt quotes "Systems Engieering has been employed ever since mankind started building and developing complex systems(1)." This comes to show that even in the earlier times there were engineering systems. To put this in another perspective, in Belize---specifically the Mayan Ruins---the Mayans created an system when creating building and since the people were more on the shorter side they learned to climb the buildings on fours to have a more effective way to continue building in higher surfaces.Going into present times, this can now be defined in multiple ways, it can be known mentally, enviornmentally, and physically. Meaning that, everything and anything needs a system engineering. 

            <h3>Differences of Ways of Thinking and How to Compare </h3> 
            <p>Onto system thinking, when one thinks about problem solvers, innovators, inventors and creative minded indivisuals is that they all have system thinking in common. For instance, all these people have the characteristics that align with the system thinking mindset. As mentioned in <i>Systems engineering: principles and practice (Third Edition)</i> Kossiaoff, Seymour, et.al it says "Systems thinking is the method of achieving and maintaining a system design in which every requirement is carefully monitored and carefully controlled, including the human factor." In other words, people who use system thinking in their daily lives achieve more as well as become more successful maintaining designs and plans. For example, if someone plans out their day they're able to ahieve what they would want to do that day. They think outside the box to solve their problems and think things out before going forward. This in comparison of linear/traditional thinking is simply the thought process of a person. For example, A person with traditional/linear thinking is when there's a point A to point B and it has an connected sequence of thoughts. Nothing goes outside those points and keeps moving straight no detours. And system thinking is the ability to take any steps to achieve the goal or plan they anticipated. If there was a problem or obstacle they would be able to move around it. </p>    

            <h3>Examples of Application of System Engineering and Thinking </h3>
            <p> To put this in perspective let's imagine a common retail floor; there's cashiers, sale associates, managers and stock associates. In order for the floor and sales to go up there must be proper system engineering in order to run business smoothly. When it comes to system thinking, all workers must have this charactertistic in order to deal with any conflict and upset customers. All in all, system engineering and system thinking are a must---especially in the workspace---</p>
            
            <h3>Overall Thoughts and Conclusion</h3>
            <p> In summary, system engineering is used in day to day lives and without it there would be no successful business, chaos and create an atomsphere of no structure. System engineering can be shown at jobs, campuses, school, construction and so much more that isn't shown in the light. As well as, with system thinking it's needed to solve problems, expand on ideas and the horizons. Without system thinking people live would be dull. There wouldn't be people pushing for greatness and uncomfrontablility of facing the unknown.</p>

            <h3>What is the Systems Development Life Cycle?</h3>
            <p>System Development Life Cycle is also known for the acronym (SDLC). It's a foundation of software companies and designs. As mentioned in <e> Software Development Life Cycle </e> GeeksforGeeks says "is a structured process that is used to design, develop, and test good-quality software." This comes to show that anything with a technological background, engineering, programming and more needs a SDLC in order to maintain the software. In addition to the process there are stages of the SDLC. There are six stages of Systems Development Life Cycle. As shown in this image <img src="images/diagram for the 6 stages of SDLC.jpg" alt= "Diagram of the 6 stages of SDLC" /> it mentions the six stages are Planning and Requirements Analysis, Defining Requirements, Design, Development, Testing and Deployment and Maintenence. This comes to show much much happens behind the scenes in regards of the SDLC. To go in depth of what the stages do it will be mentioned in the bullet list below;
            <ol> 
               <li>Planning and Requirements Analysis: This step is mostly surrounded by developers in which they create the foundation based on information that was given.</li>

               <li>Defining Requirements: In order for the process to pass it must be approve from customers and partners to ensure success. As well as, fit the guidelines for SRS (Software Requirement Specification). </li>

               <li>Design: In this stage, this is where the designers of the software come together. They make multiple designs and which gets presented to DDS (Design Document Specification). Whichever one is fits the company the best in a practical manner gets chosen. </li>

               <li>Development:During this stage, the developers start to working by following the design as well as company protocal. With this they'll need tech specialists to emphasize on no mistakes and if there are any debug them while the process is on the move.</li>

               <li>Testing: Just like any new project, there needs to be test in order to check any complications, flaws and anything under the sun that dosen't follow the company protocol. Also in this step there will be some sort of documentation to tract to ensure the best in regards of who to hire to do the job correctly.</li>

               <li>Deployment and Maintenance: This is the last stage of SDLC and if the testing goes well, good feedback and company approves than company releases it.
               </li> 
            </ol>  
               <e>Note that the bullet information came from the same article.</e></p>

            <h3>Intro of the Life Cycle Models </h3> 
            <p>Before heading straight into Life Cycle Models there will be an acroymn that will be mentioned fairly often through this paragraph and its MBSE which stands for Model Based Systems Engineering. This is important because this is goes under all the following models that will be listed shortly. Moreover in the article <e>Systems Engineering Demystified (Second Edition)</e> John Holt goes over " When modeling a System, it is important that the Model represents the System of Interest as 
            accurately as possible or, to put this another way, as accurately as is necessary to develop the System successfully (4)." </p>
            While looking more into MBSE in the Life Cycles one should know that System of Interest is needed for any model to be successful. Along with System Hierarchy and all models have a natural hierarchy and it's apart of the Ontology. Ontology is a branch of philosophy that studies concepts. So with this in mind they work together throughout all models. Now onto the topic at hand, there are a lot of Life Cycle models but, the main ones are; Waterfall Model, Agile Model, V-Shaped Model, Iterative Model and the Spiral Model. They use the stages as mentioned above but, in different ways. According to <e>Advantages and Disadvantages of SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)</e>Ghosh goes over "The Waterfall Model, introduced as the pioneer among process models, follows a linear-sequential life cycle approach, AGILE is a development approach that emphasizes continuous iteration of development and testing throughout the software development lifecycle, V-Shaped methodology, also known as the Verification and Validation model, is a software development lifecycle approach executed in a sequential manner resembling a V-shape, Iterative development is a methodology that involves breaking down the software development process into smaller, manageable chunks and he Spiral model, a hybrid approach blending iterative development with the structured elements of the waterfall model, prioritizes risk analysis throughout the software development lifecycle." All in all they have important roles and with everything there are advantages and disadvantages. 

            <h3>Advantages and Disadvantages of Life Cycle Models </h3>
            <p> Speaking of Advantages and Disadvantages of the Life Cycle Models in this paragragh I will be listing them down. Starting off with Waterfall Model the advantages would be how it's easily readable and can comprehend and processing can happen at once. The downside to this particular model is that; once its final there's no going back, customers can only see it during the final stage, and anything complex would be difficult to do. For the Agile Model the advantages would be; changing anything within the model is easy to do, stakeholders can see the whole process and customers can engage with the model. The downside is it lacks design and documentation of the project and heavy reliance of others. In regards of the V Shape Model the advantages is that its easy to plan and design, this model can prevent flaws and defect flow. On the other hand the disadvantages is that there's not a lot of flexibility, can't access earlier version of prototypes and if there's too many changes it can create inconsistency. For Iterative model advantages are it's overall easier to use, more flexible and cheaper than other models, milestones can be effectively managable. Downside is no overlapping information, process is rigid and not everything is upfront so later on it can cause problems. Lastly, the Spiral model advantages are for later changes it's flexible, repetitve is key for effective management, can ask for customer feedback as well as rapid development. Downsides are the ability to only be suitable for large projects, very strict, need more documentation, risk on budgets and might not be able to meet the numbers. As a result of all these points, when looking for a specific model make sure it fits your project and what you're willing to face in regards of conflict and additional factors that can pop up while going through the process.</p>
            
            <h3>Reflection of Importance of SDLC and its Evolution</h3>
            <p> In Conclusion, SDLC is important to have because there are stages and models needed to be follow to fit the needs of customers, stakeholders, companies and more. When starting a project it's always good to know what you're getting out of the project while using one of the Life Cycle Models. To add on while designing it's good to use SDLC's stages to make sure it aligns with what your clients want. Sustainability is important factor in regards of SDLC because money is pricy and depending on the budget it's always good to do research which model fits within how much one can spend. Finally, the evolution of digital systems first started with a linear process and now it exands to multiple stages and shapes that any developer can choose what fits best for their project. </p>
