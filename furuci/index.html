            <h3>What is System Engineering</h3> 

            <p>Behind every concept there's a foundation that is brought to light by an idea. In this instance, I'll be going over system engineering's foundation and transition into present times definition. According to <em>Systems Engineering Demystified</em>, John Holt quotes "Systems Engineering has been employed ever since mankind started building and developing complex systems (1)." This comes to show that even in earlier times there were engineering systems. To put this in another perspective, in Belize---specifically the Mayan Ruins---the Mayans created a system when creating building and since the people were more on the shorter side, they learned to climb the buildings on fours to have a more effective way to continue building in higher surfaces. Another earlier civilization would be Ancient Egypt. During their time there were hierarchies, different classes and royalties. Within this they created a sense of system of how things go down in history; they created a more organized way to deal with agriculture as well as creating the famous pyramids. As system engineers they didn’t have a compass, so they were able to detect direction based off the stars. As well as moving the stones during the building processes is that they use sleds to make transportation more effective. Going into present times, this can now be defined in multiple ways, it can be known mentally, environmentally, and physically. Meaning that, everything and anything needs system engineering.  All in all, system engineering is crucial to having a strong system that results in success, effective practices and overall, an organized established system. If it’s effective back than, it must mean something to go down the same path of creating a strong system.  

  

            <h3>Differences of Ways of Thinking and How to Compare </h3>  

            <p>Onto system thinking, when one thinks about problem solvers, innovators, inventors and creative minded individuals is that they all have system thinking in common. For instance, all these people have characteristics that align with the system thinking mindset. As mentioned in <em>Systems engineering: principles and practice (Third Edition) </em> Kossiaoff, Seymour, et.al it says, "Systems thinking is the method of achieving and maintaining a system design in which every requirement is carefully monitored and carefully controlled, including the human factor." In other words, people who use system thinking in their daily lives achieve more as well as become more successful maintaining designs and plans. For example, if someone plans out their day, they're able to achieve what they would want to do that day. They think outside the box to solve their problems and think things out before going forward. This in comparison of linear/traditional thinking is simply the thought process of a person. For example, A person with traditional/linear thinking is when there's a point A to point B and it has a connected sequence of thoughts. Nothing goes outside those points and keeps moving straight no detours. And system thinking is the ability to take any steps to achieve the goal or plan they anticipated. If there was a problem or obstacle, they would be able to move around it. This is useful to know because one won’t be successful in life if one isn’t systematic-minded. Why I say this is because they aren’t able to change and grow as an individual if it’s constantly the same path. One won’t be able to learn if they don’t change thought processes now and then. Sure, traditional linear thinkers knows the correct thought process, however, what if there was a better approach to a situation? This shows how a change of mindset can make a person grow opposed to staying the same. 
            </p>     

  

            <h3>Examples of Application of System Engineering and Thinking </h3> 

            <p> To put this in perspective let's imagine a common retail floor; there's cashiers, sale associates, managers and stock associates. For the floor and sales to go up there must be proper system engineering to run the business smoothly. When it comes to system thinking, all workers must have this characteristic to deal with any conflict and upset customers. When it comes to my personal experience, I’ve worked in retail for three years and within all my jobs in the industry there was a system in place. What I mean by this is that there were rules and instructions to follow to make sure everyone knew how to do their job. Especially during training week, the managers go over the dos and don’ts of what to do in the workplace as well as paperwork to ensure systematic thinking for all workers to rely on. Working in Bath and Body Works there was a particular way to do online orders <img src="images/bath and body works.jpeg" alt= "Bath and Body Work.”</img>. There was label making, a tablet that’s connected to the online orders and a basket to help move across the room while holding the products. This ensured completing the online order in a good amount of time. My other experience in retail was working at ZARA. This store was about having great customer service and providing help when needed and being inclusive of everyone. While getting the job there was a similar procedure in regards of Bath and Body Work’s training. It consisted of paperwork, policies to abide by, handling the cash register and self-kiosks. I was new to the kiosk and helping customers at self-check-out. The person training me showed me what to do and don’ts do in regards of how to handle the kiosks. And ZARA had this system where when we need help by calling the managers if we have questions or concerns. This created an atmosphere where all the workers knew what to do if anything popped up. ZARA and Bath and Body Works taught me to work coordinately with the companies' beliefs and staying within orders of higher ups in control of the system will make a stronger organization. All in all, system thinking is a must---especially in the workspace--- for an organized system to help our customers and stakeholders of the company. </p> 

 <p> Additionally in regards of application one must mention Model-Based System Engineering (MBSE). In one instance, MBSE is used to analyze complex systems and helps aid in the creation from the beginning to the end.  Going more into the topic at hand, application of system engineering would be; companies in the car industry. Pointers to investigate for car companies and vehicles is that MBSE is used in the processes of creating software, hardware and electrical vehicles. They must get approved for the projects that are being made to ensure a good quality vehicle. Speaking about transportation, how does public transportation run smoothly? Well, for starters they use MBSE as their foundation to get from point A to point B smoothly. Looking into the details, public transportation uses subways, highways, light rails and what they all have in common is control systems. The control system where MBSE comes to play consists of; route planning, scheduling, capacity, traffic signal priority, accessibility features and more that make public transportation efficient as possible. This comes to show that both System Thinking and MBSE are important for any project known to man it’s just projected in different light depending on the cause and company</p> 

             

            <h3>Overall Thoughts and Conclusion</h3> 

            <p> In summary, system thinking and MBSE were expressed throughout time. Using my example in the beginning of the creation of the Mayan Ruins where they had stone tools and short citizens and all the way to present times where technology is booming within the software industry and business industry. Without older generations tactics of communication, thinking, organization and idea of what a system is there wouldn’t be a source to grow from. Additionally, when it comes to thinking and communicating with a systematic mindset it’s a great characteristic to have in regards of starting projects and being in a work and business setting. In the workspace it’s an advantage to be able to go outside the box in a sense of working through conflict and work through even with obstacles. Moreover, inventors, innovators, developers and more have this mindset and this comes to show the people that stand out and create new inventions are the people that are willing to go up and beyond for the project. In comparison of traditional linear thinking with going point a to point b with no detours because it’s straightforward, it won’t go anywhere in life if one doesn’t challenge one’s thinking. Another point that is mentioned within this blog is Model Based System Engineering (MBSE). When it comes to operations, projects and new creations going is when MBSE gets invovled. Without, MBSE all the listing above won’t be organized and not even published due to information may be lost, not all the details are in the software, the system could be bugged and there isn’t anyone to check and more. MBSE helps aid any flaws within the system and without it being established everything goes down into shambles. Overall, both systematic thinking and system engineering model impact our everyday lives whether its day-to-day projects, transportation, businesses, retail and so much more. There’s more that happens behind the scenes than what is shown upfront. </p>

            <h3>What is the Systems Development Life Cycle? </h3> 

            <p>System Development Life Cycle is also known for the acronym (SDLC). It's a foundation of software companies and designs. As mentioned in<em>Software Development Life Cycle </em> GeeksforGeeks says "is a structured process that is used to design, develop, and test good-quality software." This comes to show that anything with a technological background, engineering, programming and more needs an SDLC to maintain the software. In addition, to the process there are stages of the SDLC. There are six stages of Systems Development Life Cycle. As shown in this image <img src="images/diagram for the 6 stages of SDLC.jpg" alt= "Diagram of the 6 stages of SDLC.”</img> It mentions the six stages are; Planning and Requirements Analysis, Defining Requirements, Design, Development, Testing and Deployment and Maintenance. This shows that much happens behind the scenes in regards of the SDLC. Without SDLC software wouldn’t be as clean and organized but, with SDLC it provides a plan to go over while working on a project. To go in depth of what the stages do it will be mentioned in the bullet list below; 

            <dl> 

               <dt>Planning and Requirements Analysis: This step is mostly surrounded by developers in which they create the foundation based on information that was given. </dt> 

  

               <dt>Defining Requirements: For the process to pass it must be approved from customers and partners to ensure success. As well as fit the guidelines for SRS (Software Requirement Specification). </dt> 

  

               <dt>Design: In this stage, this is where the designers of the software come together. They make multiple designs, and which gets presented to DDS (Design Document Specification). Whichever one fits the company the best in a practical manner gets chosen. </dt> 

  

               <dt>Development: During this stage, the developers start to work by following the design as well as company protocol. With this they will need tech specialists to emphasize no mistakes and if there are any debug them while the process is on the move. </dt> 

  

               <dt>Testing: Just like any new project, there needs to be a test to check for any complications, flaws, and anything under the sun that doesn't follow the company protocol. Also, in this step there will be some documentation to tract to ensure the best regarding who to hire to do the job correctly. </dt> 

  

               <dt>Deployment and Maintenance: This is the last stage of SDLC and if the testing goes well, valuable feedback and company approves than company releases it. 

               </dt>  

            </dl>   

               <em>Note that the bulleted information came from the same article. </em></p> 

 

<p>To put this in perspective, a real-life example of using these steps would be; being a part of the gaming industry and the company is going to release a new game. The developers and engineers need to go through the <strong>planning step</strong> to get everything aligned with the information given. Additionally, the <strong>defining requirements step </strong> is when testers and stakeholders approve the project to ensure success. Next would be the <strong> design step </strong> with this it entails the graphic designers for the game come together and work on the visuals for the game, if there were no visuals it wouldn’t be appealing to customers in which loses revenue. After that there’s the <strong> development stage </strong> similar to the planning step but, the game developers go over the design and double check that it fits the company protocol and get technicians involved to solve any issues/conflict that the project may have. Later, the <strong> testing step </strong> is in motion and this step in particular is an extension of development in a sense of making sure nothing is off with the project and the game moves smoothly. As well as making sure there’s required documentation that goes along with the game. And the last step would be <strong> deployment and maintenance </strong> this stage is when it’s approved by higher ups, approved and when it’s uploaded customers and stakeholders are given back feedback on the game either positive or negative. This is just one real life example of how SDLC is applied but, one could imagine that anything that is involved with software that SDLC is present in which it seems fit for the company. </p> 

  

            <h3>Intro of the Life Cycle Models </h3>  

            <p>Before heading straight into Life Cycle Models there will be an acronym that will be mentioned often through this paragraph and its MBSE which stands for Model Based Systems Engineering. This is important because this goes under all the following models that will be listed shortly. Moreover, in the article <em> Systems Engineering Demystified (Second Edition). </em> John Holt goes over " When modeling a System, it is important that the Model represents the System of Interest as accurately as possible or, to put this another way, as accurately as is necessary to develop the System successfully (4)." While looking more into MBSE in the Life Cycles one should know that System of Interest is needed for any model to be successful. Along with System Hierarchy and all models have a natural hierarchy and it is a part of the Ontology. Ontology is a branch of philosophy that studies concepts. So, with this in mind they work together throughout all models. Now onto the topic at hand, there are a lot of Life Cycle models but, the main ones are; Waterfall Model, Agile Model, V-Shaped Model, Iterative Model and the Spiral Model. They use the stages as mentioned above but in separate ways. According to <em>Advantages and Disadvantages of SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)</em> Ghosh goes over "The Waterfall Model, introduced as the pioneer among process models, follows a linear-sequential life cycle approach, AGILE is a development approach that emphasizes continuous iteration of development and testing throughout the software development lifecycle, V-Shaped methodology, also known as the Verification and Validation model, is a software development lifecycle approach executed in a sequential manner resembling a V-shape, Iterative development is a methodology that involves breaking down the software development process into smaller, manageable chunks and he Spiral model, a hybrid approach blending iterative development with the structured elements of the waterfall model, prioritizes risk analysis throughout the software development lifecycle." All in all, they have important roles and with everything there are advantages and disadvantages. </p> 

  

            <h3>Advantages and Disadvantages of Life Cycle Models </h3> 

            <p> Speaking of Advantages and Disadvantages of the Life Cycle Models, in this paragraph I will be listing them down. Starting off with the Waterfall Model the advantages would be how easily readable and how it can comprehethe business how processing can happen at once. The downside to this model is that once it's final, there is no going back, customers can only see it during the final stage, and anything complex would be difficult. For the Agile Model the advantages would be; changing anything within itself is easy to do, stakeholders can see the entire process and customers can engage with the model. The downside is it lacks design and documentation of the project and heavy reliance on others. In regards, the V Shape Model the advantages are that it's easy to plan and design, this model can prevent flaws and defect flow. On the other hand, the disadvantage is that there is not a lot of flexibility, we cannot access earlier versions of prototypes and if there is too many changes it can create inconsistency. For Iterative model advantages are it's overall easier to use, more flexible and cheaper than other models, milestones can be effectively manageable. The downside is no overlapping information; the process is rigid and not upfront, so later it can cause problems. Lastly, the Spiral model's advantages are for later changes its flexible, repetitive is key for effective management, can ask for customer feedback as well as rapid development. Downsides are the ability to only be suitable for large projects, extremely strict, need more documentation, risk on budgets and might not be able to meet the numbers. As a result of all these points, when looking for a specific model make sure it fits your project and what you are willing to face in regards of conflict and additional factors that can pop up while going through the process. </p> 

             

            <h3>Reflection of Importance of SDLC and its Evolution</h3> 

            <p> In Conclusion, SDLC is important to have because there are stages and models that need to be followed to fit the needs of customers, stakeholders, companies and more. When starting a project, it's always good to know what you're getting out of the project while using one of the Life Cycle Models. To add on while designing it's good to use SDLC's stages to make sure it aligns with what your clients want. What I mean by this is each model is created to suit different purposes; there are ones that are better with smaller projects and some that support larger projects etc. Sustainability is an important factor in regards of SDLC because money is pricy and depending on the budget it is always good to do research on which model fits within how much one can spend. This is because depending on how much one puts into the project will also impact how much one will need to spend to not only create the project but also hire specialists to make it a success. Finally, the evolution of digital systems first started with a linear process and now it expands to multiple stages and shapes so that any developer can choose what fits best for their project. </p>
