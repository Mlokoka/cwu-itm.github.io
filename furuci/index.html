            <h3>What is System Engineering</h3>
            <p>Behind every concept there's a foundation that is brought to light by an idea. In this instance, I'll be going over system engineering's foundation and transition into present times definition. According to <i>Systems Engineering Demystified</i> , John Holt quotes "Systems Engieering has been employed ever since mankind started building and developing complex systems(1)." This comes to show that even in the earlier times there were engineering systems. To put this in another perspective, in Belize---specifically the Mayan Ruins---the Mayans created an system when creating building and since the people were more on the shorter side they learned to climb the buildings on fours to have a more effective way to continue building in higher surfaces.Going into present times, this can now be defined in multiple ways, it can be known mentally, enviornmentally, and physically. Meaning that, everything and anything needs a system engineering. 

            <h3>Differences of Ways of Thinking and How to Compare </h3> 
            <p>Onto system thinking, when one thinks about problem solvers, innovators, inventors and creative minded indivisuals is that they all have system thinking in common. For instance, all these people have the characteristics that align with the system thinking mindset. As mentioned in <i>Systems engineering: principles and practice (Third Edition)</i> Kossiaoff, Seymour, et.al it says "Systems thinking is the method of achieving and maintaining a system design in which every requirement is carefully monitored and carefully controlled, including the human factor." In other words, people who use system thinking in their daily lives achieve more as well as become more successful maintaining designs and plans. For example, if someone plans out their day they're able to ahieve what they would want to do that day. They think outside the box to solve their problems and think things out before going forward. This in comparison of linear/traditional thinking is simply the thought process of a person. For example, A person with traditional/linear thinking is when there's a point A to point B and it has an connected sequence of thoughts. Nothing goes outside those points and keeps moving straight no detours. And system thinking is the ability to take any steps to achieve the goal or plan they anticipated. If there was a problem or obstacle they would be able to move around it. </p>    

            <h3>Examples of Application of System Engineering and Thinking </h3>
            <p> To put this in perspective let's imagine a common retail floor; there's cashiers, sale associates, managers and stock associates. In order for the floor and sales to go up there must be proper system engineering in order to run business smoothly. When it comes to system thinking, all workers must have this charactertistic in order to deal with any conflict and upset customers. All in all, system engineering and system thinking are a must---especially in the workspace---</p>
            
            <h3>Overall Thoughts and Conclusion</h3>
            <p> In summary, system engineering is used in day to day lives and without it there would be no successful business, chaos and create an atomsphere of no structure. System engineering can be shown at jobs, campuses, school, construction and so much more that isn't shown in the light. As well as, with system thinking it's needed to solve problems, expand on ideas and the horizons. Without system thinking people live would be dull. There wouldn't be people pushing for greatness and uncomfrontablility of facing the unknown.</p>

            <h3>What is the Systems Development Life Cycle?</h3>
            <p>System Development Life Cycle is also known for the acronym (SDLC). It's a foundation of software companies and designs. As mentioned in <e> Software Development Life Cycle </e> GeeksforGeeks says "is a structured process that is used to design, develop, and test good-quality software." This comes to show that anything with a technological background, engineering, programming and more needs a SDLC in order to maintain the software. In addition to the process there are stages of the SDLC. There are six stages of Systems Development Life Cycle. As shown in this image <img src="images/diagram for the 6 stages of SDLC.jpg" alt= "Diagram of the 6 stages of SDLC" /> it mentions the six stages are Planning&Requirements Analysis, Defining Requirements, Design, Development, Testing and Development&Maintenence. This comes to show much much happens behind the scenes in regards of the SDLC. To go in depth of what the stages do it will be mentioned in the bullet list below;</p>
            <ol> 
               <li>Planning&Requirements Analysis: This step is mostly surrounded by developers in which they create the foundation based on information that was given.</li>

               <li>Defining Requirements: In order for the process to pass it must be approve from customers and partners to ensure success. As well as, fit the guidelines for SRS (Software Requirement Specification). </li>

               <li>Design: In this stage, this is where the designers of the software come together. They make multiple designs and which gets presented to DDS (Design Document Specification). Whichever one is fits the company the best in a practical manner gets chosen. </li>

               <li>Development:During this stage, the developers start to working by following the design as well as company protocal. With this they'll need tech specialists to emphasize on no mistakes and if there are any debug them while the process is on the move.</li>
               <li>Testing: 
               <li>Development&Maintenance:
            </ol>

            <h3>Advantages and Disadvantages of Life Cycle Models </h3> 
            <p>Onto system thinking, when one thinks about problem solvers, innovators, inventors and creative minded indivisuals is that they all have system thinking in common. For instance, all these people have the characteristics that align with the system thinking mindset.

            <h3>Reflection of Importance of SDLC and its Evolution</h3>
            <p> In summary, system engineering is used in day to day lives and without it there would be no successful business, chaos and create an atomsphere of no structure. System engineering can be shown at jobs, campuses, school, construction and so much more that isn't shown in the light.
