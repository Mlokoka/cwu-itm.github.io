            <h3>What is System Engineering</h3>
            <p>Behind every concept there's a foundation that is brought to light by an idea. In this instance, I'll be going over system engineering's foundation and transition into present times definition. According to <i>Systems Engineering Demystified</i> , John Holt quotes "Systems Engieering has been employed ever since mankind started building and developing complex systems(1)." This comes to show that even in the earlier times there were engineering systems. To put this in another perspective, in Belize---specifically the Mayan Ruins---the Mayans created an system when creating building and since the people were more on the shorter side they learned to climb the buildings on fours to have a more effective way to continue building in higher surfaces.Going into present times, this can now be defined in multiple ways, it can be known mentally, enviornmentally, and physically. Meaning that, everything and anything needs a system engineering. 
            <h3>Differences of Ways of Thinking and How to Compare </h3> 
            <p>Onto system thinking, when one thinks about problem solvers, innovators, inventors and creative minded indivisuals is that they all have system thinking in common. For instance, all these people have the characteristics that align with the system thinking mindset. As mentioned in <i>Systems engineering: principles and practice (Third Edition)</i> Kossiaoff, Seymour, et.al it says "Systems thinking is the method of achieving and maintaining a system design in which every requirement is carefully monitored and carefully controlled, including the human factor." In other words, people who use system thinking in their daily lives achieve more as well as become more successful maintaining designs and plans. For example, if someone plans out their day they're able to ahieve what they would want to do that day. They think outside the box to solve their problems and think things out before going forward. This in comparison of linear/traditional thinking is simply the thought process of a person. For example, A person with traditional/linear thinking is when there's a point A to point B and it has an connected sequence of thoughts. Nothing goes outside those points and keeps moving straight no detours. And system thinking is the ability to take any steps to achieve the goal or plan they anticipated. If there was a problem or obstacle they would be able to move around it. </p>      
            <h3>Examples of Application of System Engineering and Thinking </h3>
            <p> To put this in perspective let's imagine a common retail floor; there's cashiers, sale associates, managers and stock associates. In order for the floor and sales to go up there must be proper system engineering in order to run business smoothly. When it comes to system thinking, all workers must have this charactertistic in order to deal with any conflict and upset customers. All in all, system engineering and system thinking are a must---especially in the workspace---</p>
            
            <h3>Overall Thoughts and Conclusion</h3>
            <p> In summary, system engineering is used in day to day lives and without it there would be no successful business, chaos and create an atomsphere of no structure. System engineering can be shown at jobs, campuses, school, construction and so much more that isn't shown in the light. As well as, with system thinking it's needed to solve problems, expand on ideas and the horizons. Without system thinking people live would be dull. There wouldn't be people pushing for greatness and uncomfrontablility of facing the unknown.</p>
