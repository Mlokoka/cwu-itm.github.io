            <h3>Blog Post: The Power of Systems Thinking in Complex Digital Systems Design</h3>

            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p><strong>In today's hyperconnected and increasingly complex world, designing successful digital systems requires more than just technical expertise—it demands a mindset shift.</strong> Traditional engineering approaches that focus on isolated parts of a system often fall short when dealing with modern challenges like smart cities, digital healthcare platforms, or autonomous vehicles. This is where <strong>systems thinking</strong> and <strong>Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE)</strong> come into play.</p>
          
            <p>Systems thinking enables designers and engineers to view challenges holistically, identifying how various parts interact and influence one another. MBSE, on the other hand, allows teams to simulate and validate complex systems using digital models. Together, these methods represent a paradigm shift in how we approach engineering design for the 21st century.</p>
          
            <h2>What is Systems Thinking?</h2>
            <p><strong>Systems thinking</strong> is a comprehensive method of problem-solving that treats systems as a set of interdependent and interconnected components. Unlike conventional linear thinking—which tends to analyze problems in isolation—systems thinking focuses on understanding how elements interact within the larger whole. This includes feedback loops, dynamic relationships, and emergent behaviors (<em>Holt, 2019</em>).</p>
          
            <p>This method is valuable in virtually every domain—from engineering and public policy to healthcare and environmental planning. The core idea is simple but powerful: to fully understand a system, you must consider both its components and the relationships among them.</p>
          
            <p>For instance, when redesigning a transportation app, a traditional approach might focus on optimizing travel time. But a systems thinking approach would examine the broader implications—how changes in routing affect user behavior, vehicle emissions, or city-wide traffic patterns.</p>
          
            <p>Another critical feature of systems thinking is its emphasis on feedback loops. These loops help identify not only how change occurs, but how the system reacts to that change. Positive and negative feedback loops influence whether systems stabilize or spiral into dysfunction, which is crucial in real-time digital environments like stock trading platforms or social media algorithms.</p>
          
            <h2>Linear Thinking vs. Systems Thinking</h2>
            <p><strong>Linear thinking</strong> is deeply ingrained in our education systems. It encourages us to follow clear, step-by-step logic: problem → solution, cause → effect. While this can be effective in well-bounded, simple problems (like fixing a leaky faucet), it often oversimplifies the reality of complex systems.</p>
          
            <p>Take healthcare, for example. Efforts to reduce insurance premiums often overlook interconnected issues such as pharmaceutical pricing, staffing shortages, or the inefficiencies of electronic health records. A linear solution might reduce one cost but increase strain elsewhere in the system, leading to worse outcomes overall (<em>Linear Thinking versus Systems Thinking, n.d.</em>).</p>
          
            <p><strong>Systems thinking</strong>, in contrast, recognizes that cause and effect are not always close in time or space. It helps practitioners see connections across subsystems—administration, delivery, patient experience, etc.—and anticipate unintended consequences. Rather than patching one area, it advocates for comprehensive reform that aligns all parts toward a common goal.</p>
          
            <p>This is particularly important in digital environments. Consider a software company rolling out a new feature. A linear thinker might ensure the feature works as intended, but a systems thinker will examine how it affects data security, user engagement, software load, and integration with other modules.</p>
          
            <h2>Why a Model-Based Approach is Essential</h2>
            <p><strong>Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE)</strong> complements systems thinking by offering tools to design, simulate, and analyze complex systems digitally—before they are built. Instead of relying on static documents or spreadsheets, MBSE uses visual models to represent systems and their interactions in real time.</p>
          
            <p>These models can include requirements, architecture, data flow, feedback loops, and more. This allows teams to:
              <ul>
                <li>Validate system behavior before implementation,</li>
                <li>Identify design flaws early,</li>
                <li>Communicate clearly across interdisciplinary teams,</li>
                <li>Support traceability and compliance (especially in regulated industries like defense or healthcare).</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
          
            <p>In the context of smart cities, MBSE can model how a new traffic signal timing system affects air pollution, emergency response times, and pedestrian safety. It allows for "what-if" simulations, making it possible to test policy decisions virtually.</p>
          
            <p>MBSE is especially powerful in iterative and agile development environments. As stakeholder needs evolve, models can be updated dynamically, ensuring that the system remains aligned with its goals over time.</p>
          
            <p>MBSE also fosters better collaboration in large-scale IT projects. In many environments, cross-functional teams struggle with miscommunication. MBSE offers a shared language, helping software engineers, UX designers, system architects, and project managers to align their efforts and anticipate integration challenges early.</p>
          
            <h2>Case Study: Smart Cities and Interconnected Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Smart cities</strong> present a compelling example of the power of systems thinking and MBSE in action. Cities today are complex organisms made up of transportation networks, utility systems, public safety infrastructures, social services, and economic engines—all of which are increasingly digital and data-driven.</p>
          
            <p>A decision to switch from gas-powered buses to electric ones might seem straightforward from an environmental perspective. But a systems thinking approach reveals broader implications: the increased electricity demand, the need for charging infrastructure, the effect on traffic patterns, and even changes in labor training for maintenance crews.</p>
          
            <p>With MBSE, city planners can create a <strong>digital twin</strong> of the urban environment—a comprehensive simulation of how all systems interact. This digital twin allows experimentation with different policies and technologies to predict outcomes and optimize for public good (<em>Serrano, 2018</em>).</p>
          
            <p>MBSE also supports the integration of sustainability goals into urban planning. For example, energy-efficient housing initiatives can be modeled to show long-term effects on grid usage, emissions, and even resident health outcomes. This anticipatory planning leads to smarter investment decisions and fewer unintended consequences.</p>
          
            <h2>The Aerospace and Defense Industry</h2>
            <p><strong>Nowhere is MBSE more established than in the aerospace and defense industries.</strong> These sectors deal with systems of enormous complexity—aircraft, satellites, and missile defense systems—where failure is not an option.</p>
          
            <p>Take the development of a commercial aircraft. Engineers must coordinate software, hardware, and mechanical subsystems: autopilot systems, navigation, fuel delivery, communication, and more. Each subsystem may work perfectly on its own, but what matters is how they interact. An error in integration can compromise the entire system.</p>
          
            <p>Here, MBSE enables:
              <ul>
                <li>Visualization of interactions between control systems and physical components,</li>
                <li>Early detection of conflicting requirements,</li>
                <li>Modeling of edge cases that may not emerge during initial testing,</li>
                <li>Support for lifecycle management from concept through decommissioning.</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
          
            <p><em>NASA and companies like Boeing</em> use MBSE extensively to manage complexity and ensure system safety. It reduces development time, minimizes rework, and enhances quality (<em>NASA, 2023</em>).</p>
          
            <h2>Education and Systems Literacy</h2>
            <p><strong>One barrier to wider adoption of systems thinking is education.</strong> Most engineering and IT programs still teach in silos: programming in one class, networks in another, and project management separately. While necessary, this segmentation doesn’t prepare students for the interconnected nature of real-world systems.</p>
          
            <p>To address this, some universities are incorporating MBSE and systems thinking into core curriculums. Students learn to build models, think holistically, and collaborate across disciplines—skills that are increasingly essential in today’s workplace.</p>
          
            <p>Additionally, offering systems modeling exercises through project-based learning helps students gain firsthand experience. Assignments that involve developing simulations for smart grid systems or emergency services can foster deep understanding and innovation.</p>
          
            <p>Moreover, as systems literacy spreads beyond engineering, it can empower policymakers, entrepreneurs, and citizens to engage in more informed decision-making. From climate change to digital privacy, a systems lens is critical for designing sustainable solutions.</p>
          
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p><strong>In an age of complexity, systems thinking and MBSE are no longer optional—they are essential.</strong> These approaches offer the tools and mindset necessary to design, evaluate, and evolve complex digital systems that are resilient, adaptive, and human-centered.</p>
          
            <p>Systems thinking provides the lens to understand interdependencies, anticipate unintended consequences, and make thoughtful decisions. MBSE offers the toolkit to bring these insights to life through simulation, iteration, and collaboration.</p>
          
            <p>When integrated together, these methods create a foundation for not just solving problems but proactively designing systems that evolve with society’s changing needs. As our digital infrastructures become more intertwined with every aspect of life, the need for system-aware, model-driven innovation will only grow stronger.</p>
          
            <p>Whether you're designing a smart city, building a healthcare platform, or launching an aerospace project, embracing these principles will lead to smarter, safer, and more sustainable outcomes.</p>

            <h1>Navigating Complexity with Systems Thinking and Model-Based Systems Engineering</h1>

            <p><strong>In today's fast-paced and interconnected world</strong>, designing successful digital systems requires more than assembling functional parts. Engineers must build solutions that are adaptive, sustainable, and responsive to technical, environmental, and societal changes. <strong>Systems Thinking</strong> and <strong>Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE)</strong> provide vital frameworks to address this complexity. This blog focuses on the <strong>Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC)</strong>, its phases, and how life cycle models—linear, iterative, and incremental—align with MBSE to ensure robust system design, sustainability, and evolution.</p>
          
            <h2>Section 1: Systems Thinking – A Holistic Viewpoint</h2>
          
            <p>Systems thinking emphasizes understanding the interrelationships between a system's components rather than isolating them. It addresses complexity by identifying feedback loops, root causes, and emergent behaviors. <strong>This holistic view</strong> is critical in managing modern systems. For example, designing a digital public transportation platform involves urban infrastructure, user behavior, environmental policies, and maintenance cycles.</p>
          
            <p>According to Checkland (1981), there are five types of systems: <em>transcendent, human activity, created abstract, natural, and designed physical systems</em>. Understanding the system type helps define goals, constraints, and effective design strategies.</p>
          
            <h2>Section 2: MBSE – A Model-Centric Engineering Approach</h2>
          
            <p><strong>MBSE replaces document-centric processes with dynamic, digital models</strong> that evolve as the system progresses. These models improve collaboration, reduce ambiguity, and ensure alignment across all phases of development. Holt (2021) emphasizes MBSE’s value in enhancing communication and reducing errors early.</p>
          
            <p>For example, aerospace engineers use MBSE to simulate aircraft systems and explore how changes in one subsystem impact the rest. <strong>This level of integration is difficult to achieve with traditional methods</strong>.</p>
          
            <h2>Section 3: Understanding the Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC)</h2>
          
            <p>The SDLC outlines the journey a system undergoes from beginning to end. According to ISO/IEC 15288, it includes six key phases:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Conception:</strong> Define stakeholder needs and system goals.</li>
              <li><strong>Development:</strong> Design and prototype potential solutions.</li>
              <li><strong>Production:</strong> Construct and verify the system.</li>
              <li><strong>Utilization:</strong> Operate the system in its environment.</li>
              <li><strong>Support:</strong> Maintain and update the system.</li>
              <li><strong>Retirement:</strong> Decommission the system safely.</li>
            </ul>
          
            <p>MBSE strengthens every phase by maintaining a digital model that captures decisions, changes, and system evolution.</p>
          
            <h2>Section 4: Life Cycle Models in Systems Engineering</h2>
          
            <h3>1. Linear (Waterfall) Model</h3>
            <p>This sequential model suits well-defined projects. However, it lacks flexibility. <strong>MBSE reduces risk</strong> by enabling early validation and simulation before implementation (Holt, 2021).</p>
          
            <h3>2. Iterative Model</h3>
            <p>This model promotes repeated cycles of development and feedback. <strong>MBSE enables real-time collaboration and continuous refinement</strong>. INCOSE (2015) supports MBSE's use in evolving systems.</p>
          
            <h3>3. Incremental Model</h3>
            <p>Here, the system is delivered in parts. <strong>MBSE facilitates modular design</strong>, allowing independent modeling and testing of each increment before integration (IBM, 2024).</p>
          
            <h2>Section 5: MBSE Across the SDLC – Enabling Design, Sustainability, and Evolution</h2>
          
            <p>MBSE contributes to every stage of the SDLC:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Design:</strong> Enables simulation and comparison of design alternatives.</li>
              <li><strong>Sustainability:</strong> Models can be updated to reflect system changes over time.</li>
              <li><strong>Evolution:</strong> Version control and traceability help in planning upgrades or transitions.</li>
            </ul>
          
            <p>MBSE models become living artifacts that evolve with the system and support decision-making throughout its operational life.</p>
          
            <h2>Section 6: Real-World Applications of MBSE</h2>
          
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Aerospace:</strong> NASA uses MBSE to model spacecraft and reduce mission risk.</li>
              <li><strong>Automotive:</strong> Ford uses MBSE to manage electric vehicle system complexity.</li>
              <li><strong>Healthcare:</strong> MBSE supports integration of smart medical devices with IT systems.</li>
            </ul>
          
            <h2>Section 7: Benefits of MBSE Throughout the Life Cycle</h2>
          
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Improved communication:</strong> Visual models enhance stakeholder understanding.</li>
              <li><strong>Error detection:</strong> Simulations catch flaws early.</li>
              <li><strong>Traceability:</strong> Maintains links between design, requirements, and testing.</li>
              <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Automated documentation and model reuse reduce time.</li>
              <li><strong>Adaptability:</strong> Models can evolve with the system.</li>
            </ul>
          
            <p>As Holt (2021) highlights, MBSE is not just a technique—it’s a strategic tool for resilient and future-proof systems.</p>
          
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          
            <p><strong>Engineering today demands integrated solutions</strong>. Systems thinking gives us the mindset; MBSE gives us the tools. Together, they help engineers build adaptive, sustainable, and successful digital systems across the full life cycle. Whether linear, iterative, or incremental, MBSE enhances every approach by enabling clarity, consistency, and confidence in system development.</p>

               <h1>Designing for People – The Heart of Usability and UX</h1>
             
               <p>
                 Successful digital products need to connect with people in addition to functioning in a world where screens and interfaces rule. Fundamentally, usability and user experience (UX) design are not about beautiful code or flashy graphics. <strong>Empathy is key.</strong> Designing for people involves knowing how individuals see, think, feel, and act in digital spaces.
               </p>
             
               <p>
                 Too often, product teams fall into the trap of designing for assumed user needs rather than verified ones. Features are prioritized based on business goals or technical feasibility without ever validating whether those features actually address a real pain point. Human-centered design corrects this by introducing continuous user feedback into the development process, ensuring that every design decision is backed by real-world insight.
               </p>
             
               <p>
                 Designers and developers now have amazing power because of the digital age, but that power also comes with responsibility. Our perspective changes from <em>"what can we build?"</em> to <em>"what should we build to make lives better?"</em> when we place human needs at the heart of our process. This approach transforms designers from implementers into partners, issue solvers, and user advocates.
               </p>
             
               <p>
                 This blog post explores the essence of human-centered design (HCD), contrasts two influential approaches—ISO 9241-210 and IDEO's Field Guide—and explains how foundational concepts like perception, visual hierarchy, and UX laws shape better experiences.
               </p>
             
               <h2>What is Human-Centered Design?</h2>
             
               <p>
                 The process known as Human-Centered Design (HCD) is based on the idea that the requirements of the people you're creating for must come first. The <a href="https://d1r3w4d5z5a88i.cloudfront.net/assets/guide/Field%20Guide%20to%20Human-Centered%20Design_IDEOorg_English-0f60d33bce6b870e7d80f9cc1642c8e7.pdf" target="_blank">IDEO Field Guide to Human-Centered Design (2015)</a> states that HCD entails closely interacting with actual users, watching their behaviors, and iteratively developing solutions that satisfy their needs and have a significant impact.
               </p>
             
               <p>
                 The <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/77520.html" target="_blank">ISO 9241-210 standard</a> defines HCD as an approach that ensures systems are usable and useful by focusing on users' needs and applying human factors and usability principles (ISO, 2019). Despite different expressions, both approaches prioritize one core idea: <strong>start with people, and design around them</strong>.
               </p>
             
               <p>
                 One of the most significant and distinctive aspects of a designer's worldview is empathy, which is the foundation of human-centered design. Beyond demographics and personas, it probes people's feelings, actions, drives, and annoyances.
               </p>
             
               <p>
                 Whether you're creating a public website for social service applications or a mobile app for scheduling doctor's appointments, HCD requires direct user contact to find potential and pain spots. For instance, observing elderly users attempting to navigate a telemedicine portal might reveal unexpected usability barriers such as difficulties with small fonts, confusing icons, or multiple log-in steps.
               </p>
             
               <p>
                 Rather than guessing at their needs, HCD emphasizes immersion—sitting beside users, watching them interact, and asking open-ended questions. Only by truly understanding the human context can designers propose solutions that are not only functional but meaningful.
               </p>
             
               <p>
                 The empathy-driven nature of HCD also ensures inclusivity. A system designed through human-centered practices will take into account a broader spectrum of users, including those with disabilities, lower literacy levels, or limited access to technology. In that sense, HCD becomes more than a methodology—it becomes an <strong>ethical commitment to equity in digital experiences</strong>.
               </p>
             
               <p>
                 HCD's broad adoption in industries ranging from finance and urban planning to health care and education can be attributed to this holistic perspective on the human experience. Whether addressing a little usability problem or a significant systemic design difficulty, human-centered design maintains the focus on people.
               </p>
             
               <h2>Comparing ISO 9241-210 and IDEO's Field Guide</h2>
             
               <p>
                 While ISO 9241-210 and IDEO's Field Guide share the common goal of prioritizing user needs, they differ significantly in tone, methodology, and intended audience.

                 ISO 9241-210 is formal and standard-driven, emphasizing usability, efficiency, and risk mitigation, making it ideal for enterprise and complex systems. It follows six structured phases:
               </p>
             
               <ul>
                 <li>Planning the HCD process</li>
                 <li>Understanding the context of use</li>
                 <li>Specifying user requirements</li>
                 <li>Producing design solutions</li>
                 <li>Evaluating with users</li>
                 <li>Iterating as needed</li>
               </ul>
             
               <p>
                 In contrast, IDEO's Field Guide is empathetic and storytelling-focused, geared toward social innovation and creative empowerment. Its three nonlinear phases—<strong>Inspiration, Ideation, and Implementation</strong>—encourage participatory research and rapid prototyping.
               </p>
             
               <p>
                 IDEO emphasizes learning from failure, collaboration, and real-world engagement, particularly in grassroots, startup, or NGO contexts. Together, these approaches highlight two complementary paths toward human-centered innovation: one grounded in precision and structure, the other in empathy and experimentation.

               <h2>Perception, Attention, and Visual Hierarchy in UX</h2>
             
               <p>
                 In UX, perception refers to how people organize and understand visual components. Gestalt concepts, such as resemblance and proximity, help users grasp how items relate to one another.
               </p>
             
               <p>
                 <strong>For instance, grouped buttons in Google Docs (text formatting, paragraph alignment) facilitate the proximity-based discovery of features.</strong>
               </p>
             
               <h3>Visual Hierarchy</h3>
             
               <p>
                 Visual hierarchy dictates the order in which users process content. Designers use size, color, contrast, layout, and whitespace to draw attention to the most important elements first. Proper hierarchy reduces decision fatigue and increases task efficiency.
               </p>
             
               <p>
                 <strong>Example:</strong> Apple's website emphasizes product names and calls to action using large fonts and bold contrasts. Supporting details appear lower or in smaller fonts, letting users focus on what matters. This conscious control over the user’s visual journey mirrors the principles of storytelling—guiding the viewer step by step toward their goal.
               </p>
             
               <p>
                 When perception and hierarchy are misused or ignored, the result is cognitive overload. Users are forced to decode disorganized information and might abandon the task altogether. <strong>Clear visual guidance isn't just an aesthetic choice—it's a usability imperative.</strong>
               </p>
             
             </body>
             </html>
             <h2>Applying UX Laws</h2>

             <p>Four foundational UX laws provide additional guidance to support perception and hierarchy. Each law reinforces a deeper understanding of how people interact with interfaces.</p>
             
             <h3>1. Jakob's Law</h3>
             <p><em>"Users spend most of their time on other websites."</em></p>
             <p>Users anticipate recognizable patterns. Confusion, annoyance, and abandonment can result from breaking accepted design conventions.</p>
             <p><strong>Example:</strong> Airbnb uses interface patterns similar to other booking platforms—filters, image galleries, calendar pickers—reducing learning time and aligning with user expectations (Nielsen, 2000).</p>
             
             <h3>2. Fitts's Law</h3>
             <p><em>"The time to acquire a target is a function of the distance to and size of the target."</em></p>
             <p>Large, strategically positioned, and quickly accessible buttons are ideal for frequently used applications, particularly on touchscreens with limited motor accuracy.</p>
             <p><strong>Example:</strong> In accordance with <a href="https://m3.material.io/components/buttons/guidelines" target="_blank">Google's Material Design standards</a> for accessible mobile interaction, Gmail's "Compose" button is big, vividly colored, and positioned within thumb reach on mobile devices (Google, 2023).</p>
             
             <h3>3. Hick's Law</h3>
             <p><em>"Decision time increases with the number and complexity of choices."</em></p>
             <p>Simplifying choices and categorizing options helps users act more quickly and confidently.</p>
             <p><strong>Example:</strong> Slack applies Hick’s Law by using progressive disclosure—initially showing basic options and letting users uncover advanced settings only when needed. This design prevents decision paralysis for new users (<a href="https://cdn.oujdalibrary.com/books/591/591-laws-of-ux-design-principles-for-persuasive-and-ethical-products-(www.tawcer.com).pdf" target="_blank">Yablonski, 2020</a>).</p>
             
             <h3>4. Miller's Law</h3>
             <p><em>"The average person can hold 7 ± 2 items in working memory."</em></p>
             <p>Chunking content into digestible parts helps users retain and process information more efficiently.</p>
             <p><strong>Example:</strong> Amazon product pages divide information into tabs—Description, Reviews, and Q&A—allowing users to focus on relevant content without being overwhelmed (Krug, 2014).</p>
             
             <h2>Final Reflection: Designing With, Not Just For</h2>
             
             <p>Designing with people in mind is a significant departure from conventional usability techniques. It entails accepting iteration, recognizing user viewpoints, and designing with them. Previously, design was determined from the top down, but now co-creation and collaboration provide the most powerful digital experiences.</p>
             
             <p>For businesses operating in regulated or high-stakes industries, ISO 9241-210 provides an organized, trustworthy path that is essential. It guarantees usability by using repeatable procedures and thorough documentation. However, as we have shown, structure is insufficient on its own.</p>
             
             <p>IDEO's Field Guide brings in the human element—empathy, immersion, and inspiration. It opens the door to innovation by embracing ambiguity, failure, and feedback. In grassroots or community-centered design, it’s often this approach that uncovers real, unmet needs.</p>
             
             <p>These frameworks provide a potent toolset when combined. Teams can utilize structured usability testing to evaluate their ideas after conducting immersive fieldwork to find latent user needs. This hybrid approach guarantees that the answers are not only practical and applicable, but also emotionally meaningful.</p>
             
             <p>As digital products continue to shape the way we live, work, and connect, the importance of designing for people only grows. Whether you follow ISO, IDEO, or your own hybrid model, one truth remains: <strong>great design starts with empathy—and ends in impact.</strong></p>

    <h1>Designing for Usability: How Memory, Vision, and Mental Shortcuts Shape Digital Interaction</h1>
  </header>

  <section>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Why does it feel like an uphill battle to utilize some digital systems while others are so easy? How well a system fits with human perception, thought, memory, and behavior is the answer. Usability is more than just aesthetics; it's about minimizing cognitive load, honoring memory function, and reacting as users anticipate. When designers overlook the realities of how users see, think, and remember, even the most powerful tools can become frustrating obstacles. In contrast, interfaces that feel natural and responsive are often deeply rooted in cognitive and behavioral science.</p>
  
    <p>This blog draws upon Tesler's Law of Conservation of Complexity, Jeff Johnson's <em>Designing with the Mind in Mind</em> (Ch. 6–9), ethical UX principles, and best practices in accessibility and visual communication to explore what makes a digital system genuinely usable. It examines core psychological constraints such as visual focus, memory limitations, and attention span, and offers real-world examples that demonstrate how good design can improve not only task efficiency, but also emotional well-being and trust. In a world increasingly shaped by digital tools, understanding usability is no longer optional—it’s essential to creating inclusive, effective, and ethical systems.</p>
  </section>  

  <section>
    <h2>1. Human Perception: Designing with Vision in Mind</h2>
    <p>The first step in visual design is to comprehend how people see. Even while displays provide information on the whole canvas, not all of it is equally visible to our eyes. Despite making up only around 1% of the retina, our foveal vision—the sharp center of our gaze—receives half of the visual cortex's processing power, claims Johnson (2020). While human peripheral vision is good at detecting motion, it is not very good at recognizing color, form, or writing.</p>
    <p>Although people concentrate on a small portion of the screen, designers frequently believe that consumers "see everything" on it. Unless they move or are exceptionally bright, static things outside of this focus are readily overlooked (Johnson, 2020). For this reason, important options, system status updates, and call-to-action buttons ought to always be located in the center of the screen. A "Submit" button, for instance, should never be hidden in a corner where users can miss it.</p>

    </figure>

  <section>
    <h2>2. Memory and Mental Models: Reducing the Mental Load</h2>
    <p>Only 5 to 9 items can usually be stored in human short-term memory for a few seconds unless they are practiced. According to Johnson (2020), long-term memory is broad but influenced by emotion and circumstance, making it frequently erroneous.</p>
    <p>Designers have to deal with this constraint by:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Showing instead of telling</li>
      <li>Maintaining visibility of instructions</li>
      <li>Information chunking and step reduction (Johnson, 2020, Ch. 7)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For instance, a form that shows past inputs (such as a search phrase they remember or autofill recommendations) enables users to identify rather than remember.</p>
    <p>Mental models also play a huge role. Users build internal models of how systems work based on past experiences. For example, a gear icon usually implies “settings.” Violating these expectations confuses and frustrates users. Snapchat's early interface famously lacked labeled icons and traditional navigation, leading new users to feel alienated and disoriented.</p>

  <h2>3. Attention, Tasks, and Interface Flow</h2>
  <p>Johnson (2020, Ch. 8) describes user behavior through the goal-execute-evaluate cycle:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Set a goal</li>
    <li>Take action</li>
    <li>Evaluate results</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Interfaces should support this cycle by:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Making next steps clear</li>
    <li>Providing real-time feedback</li>
    <li>Allowing users to undo or confirm actions</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Multistep tasks should also:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Show progress</li>
    <li>Preserve the user’s state</li>
    <li>Offer breadcrumbs or status indicators</li>
  </ul>
  <p>For instance, online tax applications like TurboTax guide users one question at a time, clearly tracking progress while preserving prior responses. This method supports task continuity and reduces anxiety, especially in systems that require high accuracy.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>4. Recognition Over Recall</h2>
  <p>The idea that recognition is simpler than recall is reaffirmed by Johnson (2020, Ch. 9). Individuals recognize well-known symbols, thumbnails, and labels far more quickly than they can recall names or orders.</p>
  <p>Effective systems leverage recognition by:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Showing menus rather than hiding options behind commands</li>
    <li>Using icons with text labels</li>
    <li>Highlighting frequent or recent actions</li>
  </ul>
  <p>For instance, Spotify enables users to immediately re-engage without searching by displaying their favorite playlists and recently played songs at the top of the homepage. Poor systems, on the other hand, depend on users to "guess what's next" or "remember what to type." Drop-offs result from users being frustrated.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>5. Feedback: Making Systems Feel Alive</h2>
  <p>Systems interact through feedback. Giving prompt feedback, whether it be to validate an action, point out mistakes, or illustrate progress, fosters flow and trust. According to Johnson (2020), consumers use feedback to "evaluate results," which completes the cycle of their interactions.</p>
  <p>Real-time alerts and snack bars are excellent instances of non-intrusive feedback. Snackbars should be positioned at the bottom of the screen with brief, understandable text and optional actions like "Undo," according to Material Design 3 (n.d.).</p>
  <p>For instance, a Snackbar titled "Note deleted – Undo" appears after a note is erased in Google Keep, allowing users to take control while verifying the activity. Without feedback, users doubt the effectiveness of their actions, which might result in mistakes, repetition, or desertion.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src="images/unnamed.png" alt="Example of a Snackbar UI with Undo button" width="600">
    <figcaption>Figure 3: A Snackbar provides unobtrusive, time-bound feedback with optional actions. Source: Material Design 3</figcaption>
  </figure>
  
</section>
<section>
  <h2>6. Cognitive Load: Where Bad Design Fails Us</h2>
  <p>Cognitive load increases when users must:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Remember previous steps</li>
    <li>Interpret vague labels</li>
    <li>Navigate complex menus</li>
    <li>Process too much information at once</li>
  </ul>
  <p>According to Tesler's Law, complexity is unavoidable, but the system should bear the majority of the load rather than the user (Tesler, 1984). Designers must either conceal complicated tasks under intuitive design or automate portions of them.</p>
  <p>For instance, Gmail's Smart Compose anticipates your sentence, copies the sender's information, and suggests responses. This simplifies the process by adding complexity to the system.</p>
  <p><strong>Bad example:</strong> Students must manually search for codes, copy them, and hope they input them correctly in many university registration systems, which transfers all the work to the user.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>7. Real-World Examples: Good vs. Bad Usability</h2>
  <p>An excellent example is the language-learning program Duolingo, which makes use of minimal decision points, gamified feedback, and habit loops. Filho (2022) asserts that "Duolingo lowers friction by using chunked content, positive feedback, and familiar layouts." Memory strain is reduced because users always know what to do next and the software retains their progress.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src="images/1_wIwDWvbzT7slfz6akQX3yg.png" alt="Duolingo app interface showing user progress and gamification elements" width="600">
    <figcaption>Figure 2: Duolingo uses intuitive progress indicators and familiar iconography. Source: UX Collective / Medium</figcaption>
  </figure>
  

  <p><strong>Bad Example:</strong> EMRs (Electronic Medical Records): According to Downing, Bates, and Longhurst (2020), the majority of EMRs are erratic, disorganized, and offer little in the way of feedback. Doctors frequently experience user burnout as a result of these systems, spending more time navigating interfaces than assisting patients. Patient treatment is compromised by the unclear layout and absence of real-time feedback.</p>

  <p>These illustrations demonstrate that usability affects user well-being, safety, and performance and is not a luxury.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>8. Ethical Design: When Usability Becomes a Responsibility</h2>
  <p>Ethical obligation accompanies enormous design capability. Persuasive design elements, such as endless scroll, autoplay, and notification loops, leverage behavioral psychology to keep users interested, frequently at the expense of their mental health, as explained in Chapter 11 of Laws of UX. Pull-to-refresh, for instance, simulates how slot machines operate and offers varying payout schedules that encourage compulsive monitoring (Laws of UX, Ch. 11).</p>

  <p>Despite their apparent "engagement," these patterns have cognitive consequences, particularly for teenagers whose self-control and attention spans are still growing.</p>

  <p>Ethical design means:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Limiting harmful loops</li>
    <li>Providing opt-outs and time settings</li>
    <li>Designing with marginalized users in mind</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Default settings also shape behavior. Most users don’t change defaults, so setting “opt-in tracking” or “dark mode” as default can influence user behavior silently. Despite its well-meaning creation, Facebook's "Like" button has had detrimental effects on social validation and anxiety (Laws of UX, Ch. 11).</p>

  <p>Ethical usability prioritizes the user's emotional and psychological safety in addition to usability.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Designing for usability requires a thorough grasp of how people see, think, remember, and act; it is not about slick features or minimalist fashions. The best systems assist the user at every stage—from task-oriented attention to the ethical use of persuasive design, and from foveal focus to short-term memory—without requiring them to think more than is necessary. Tesler's Law must be followed by designers, who must bear complexity for the user. They must respect attentional boundaries, provide real-time input, employ graphics carefully, and design for recognition rather than recall. Lastly, they need to use their design power in an ethical way, creating systems that are not just functional but also compassionate.</p>

  <p>In addition to lowering friction, a usable system improves inclusivity, satisfaction, and trust. People are more likely to stick with a system, refer others to it, and accomplish their objectives when they feel comfortable using it. However, poorly designed interfaces drive users away, increase mistakes, and can have serious consequences in crucial industries like healthcare or finance. As a result, usability is an essential part of responsible digital design and not a secondary consideration.</p>

  <p>In a time when almost every part of our lives is shaped by digital systems, it is a professional duty to design with empathy. This involves anticipating user requirements, respecting their cognitive boundaries, and staying away from deceptive tactics that take advantage of human psychology in order to increase engagement. Remember that the best technology feels human, not just works well, whether you're creating a language app, a healthcare portal, or an online store.</p>

  <p>Allow the language of clarity, purpose, and care to be expressed through each button, layout, and interaction. That's what truly usable design is all about.</p>
