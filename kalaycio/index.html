            <h3>Model-Based Systems Engineering and Systems Thinking</h3>
            <p>Creating successful and more user friednly digital environments in a world where technologies are interconnected calls for more than just technical knowledge, it calls for a different way of thinking. That new perspective can be found through systems thinking, a topic we explore in this week's reading, Systems Engineering Demystified. Systems thinking pushes us to think outside the box, see the larger picture, and consider how the parts work together, in contrast to typical linear thinking. It encourages us to recognize interdependencies, anticipate unintended consequences, and understand stakeholder perspectives. This kind of thinking is no longer optional in the complicated and rapidly evolving world of today—it is absolutely necessary for designing systems that are resilient, adaptive, and user-centered.

               Building digital systems without knowing how one component works with the others is not a very good idea in our modern advanced world. Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) is a solution to that problem. Engineers can design, test, and improve systems holistically with MBSE before writing a single line of code, reducing risk and enhancing collaboration across teams (Holt, 2021). In this blog, I will explore what systems thinking really means, how it compares to older approaches, and why MBSE is so critical for building reliable, user-centered digital environments that can adapt to real-world complexity.
               </p>
            <h3>What Is Systems Thinking?</h3>
            <p>To put it simply and clear, systems thinking is a succesfull method of understanding the world around us by focusing on the connections and patterns among objects rather than just the objects themselves. Instead of dividing issues into separate parts, systems thinking takes into account how those parts work together to create a whole. According to Jon Holt's Systems Engineering Demystified, systems thinking is the cornerstone of all systems engineering methodologies. Holt claims that systems are composed of interdependent parts that create boundaries, interfaces, structures, requirements, and limitations (Holt, 2021). According to the book, we can't fully understand a system by examining each of its components separately; rather, we have to understand how those parts interact and what outside factors have an impact on them. 
               This mindset contrasts sharply with the more linear and reductionist thinking that dominated traditional engineering disciplines. Systems thinking places more emphasis on the relationships and context of those elements than reductionism does on the analysis of individual parts. </p>
            <h3>Systems Thinking vs. Traditional Linear Thinking</h3>
            <p>The foundation of linear thinking is the idea that all causes have direct effects (Linear Thinking: The Ultimate Guide | MindManager, 2022). It's clear, dependable, and simple to understand, yet it has limitations. Actions in digital systems frequently have indirect effects, and several elements simultaneously affect results. 
               Imagine a software development team that wants to enhance the performance of a website. A linear thinker would say "The site is slow, let's optimize image sizes," Although it might be useful, it misses the larger picture. A systems thinker would examine the ways in which various elements, such as databases, frontend resources, user traffic, and third-party integrations, interact and affect overall performance. 
               Systems thinking additionally helps teams in solving "wicked problems," which are complex, poorly organized challenges that lack a clear solution. These issues are prevalent in modern engineering, as solutions for one problem can lead to new ones in another (Arnold & Wade, 2015). Such complexity is difficult for traditional thinking to handle. When you can separate variables and solve them on your own, it performs exceptionally well. However, linear thinking on its own becomes a weakness as digital systems become more user-centered and creative. We must adopt an approach that values interdependency, complexity, and uncertainty. That's what systems thinking promises.</p>
            <h3>The Role of MBSE in Systems Thinking</h3>
            <p>Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) is the set of methods that makes systems thinking a reality. The parts of a system, including its stakeholders, constraints, and other components, are represented, examined, and managed by MBSE using visual models. According to Holt (2021), MBSE replaces interactive, digital models that work as a "single source of truth" for traditional document-heavy methodologies. This promotes flexible, user-focused design, improves collaboration, and lowers errors by enabling teams to model systems before they are constructed. 
               MBSE is particularly effective when systems are too complicated to adequately explain in text documents alone. Think of a contemporary smart city platform that combines public services, emergency systems, energy consumption statistics, and traffic monitors. It would be hard to design such a system with basic spreadsheets. Teams can visualize relationships, spot any problems, and make sure all stakeholder requirements are satisfied with the help of MBSE. 
               When it comes to guaranteeing traceability—the capacity to follow requirements from creation to execution, MBSE is especially helpful. In highly regulated industries like healthcare or flight, where systems have to live up to strict compliance standards, this is crucial. </p>
            <h3>MBSE and Digital Product Design</h3>
            <p>MBSE is not limited to engineers working in the automotive or aerospace industries. It is becoming more and more significant in the design of digital services, apps, and software. Before development starts, designers and engineers can map out elements and their interactions using MBSE. This guarantees that the finished product satisfies user needs and company objectives in addition to avoiding expensive errors. According to a study in the book called "Model based systems engineering : fundamentals and methods" (Micouin, 2014), MBSE enhances early-stage decision-making, which lowers development time and expenses. Teams can confidently evolve, test user journeys, and model situations rather than speculating</p>
            <h3>Cooperation and Interaction in MBSE</h3>
            <p>The fact that MBSE develops better teamwork is among its most underappreciated advantages.  MBSE enhances communication between designers, engineers, stakeholders, and users by providing common models and visual aids.
               One of the "Three Evils of Systems Engineering," according to Holt in Systems Engineering Demystified, is communication failure, which occurs when teams misunderstand requirements or ignore stakeholder viewpoints (Holt, 2021). In order to solve this, MBSE develops models that are usable by team members other than engineers. MBSE makes it simpler to have fruitful conversations and guarantee that everyone is on the same page.</p>
            <h3>Why Are Systems Thinking and MBSE Important Now</h3>
            <p>Digital systems are not limited to individual devices anymore. They enable global supply networks, AI-powered platforms, smart homes, and health trackers, among other things. Systems thinking and MBSE are not only beneficial, but also necessary as these systems become more integrated and complicated. 
               Using systems thinking teaches us to tackle issues from an extensive point of view. We take emerging actions, stakeholder viewpoints, and unexpected impacts into account. By collectively and transparently viewing, modeling, and improving systems, MBSE offers the means to take action on that viewpoint. 
               Using these strategies produces better results, systems that are flexible, user-centered, and change-resistant, whether you're creating a basic website or a business platform.</p>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Learning MBSE and systems thinking has already changed my approach to projects as an IT and digital design student. I now view digital tools as systems, with users, interfaces, limitations, and settings that influence every choice, rather than separate "things." 
               This blog post is only the first step. I'll continue to use these guidelines as I work on HTML, CSS, and GitHub projects, asking not simply "What should this do?" but also "How does this fit into the bigger picture?" And I think that's what systems thinking really excels at.</p>

            <h3>From Chaos to Clarity: How Systems Thinking and MBSE Streamline Complex Engineering Projects</h3>
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>Systems integration is central to today’s most ambitious engineering endeavors, whether developing autonomous vehicles or building smart cities. These projects involve more than just clever components—they require carefully managed complexity. That’s where systems thinking and Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) come into play.

               In this post, I, Osman Kalayci, explore how systems thinking reshapes our understanding of complexity and how MBSE provides the tools to manage it. I also highlight how system development life cycles (SDLCs)—specifically the linear, iterative, and incremental models—help structure system evolution, and why these models are essential for building sustainable digital systems.</p>
            <h3>Systems Thinking: Seeing the Bigger Picture</h3>
            <p>At its heart, systems thinking is a way of understanding how individual parts relate to the whole. It teaches engineers to move beyond isolated problem-solving and look for broader patterns and relationships.

               <p>“Systems thinking is a way of thinking that enables people to see the forest and the trees.” – Meadows (2008)</p>
               
               This mindset is essential in digital systems, which often interact with environmental, social, political, and economic forces. Consider a 5G rollout—it involves not only hardware and network performance, but also regulation, health perceptions, and software integration.
               Benefits of systems thinking in digital system design:
           <p>1) Helps identify unintended consequences.</p>
           <p>2) Improves communication across disciplines.</p> 
            <p>3)Encourages sustainable and ethical design choices.</p>
            <h3>Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE): A Tool for Managing Complexity</h3>
            <p>Once systems thinking sets the stage, MBSE makes it actionable. MBSE replaces static documents with interactive models that represent requirements, design, behavior, and constraints in one unified structure.

               According to Estefan (2007), MBSE provides a "single source of truth" that evolves alongside the system. It is especially critical in digital environments, where requirements change frequently and components are deeply interconnected.
              <p>Why MBSE is key to system sustainability and evolution:</p> 

            <p>1) Models adapt as the system evolves, unlike static documentation.</p>

            <p>2) Simulations help engineers anticipate performance and failures.</p>

            <p>3) Real-time collaboration reduces silos and delays.</p>

            <h3>Understanding Life Cycle Models in Digital Systems</h3>
            <p>Life cycle models provide a roadmap for guiding systems from idea to retirement. In digital systems, they’re not just about organizing tasks—they’re about ensuring the system can scale, adapt, and endure over time.

               <p>Let’s look at how MBSE supports each model and why each matters for sustainable design:</p>
           <p><b>1) Linear Life Cycle Model (Waterfall)</b></p>
            <p>Use case: Systems with stable, well-defined requirements (e.g., bridge design, manufacturing software).</p>
            <p><b>Key characteristics:</b></p>
         <p>1)Sequential steps: define → design → build → test → deploy</p>
      <p>2) Minimal flexibility for changes once a phase is complete</p>
      <p><b>MBSE advantages in linear models:</b></p>
   <p>1)Early system modeling uncovers issues before costly mistakes are made</p>
<p>2) Simulations validate assumptions during the design phase</p>
<p>3) Ensures traceability throughout the process</p>
<p><b>Why it matters:</b></p> 
<p>This model works well when sustainability is built in from the start. MBSE helps catch design flaws early, ensuring long-term reliability and minimizing costly rework (Friedenthal et al., 2011).</p>
<p><b>2) Iterative Life Cycle Model</b></p>
<p><b>Use case:</b></p>
<p>Systems with evolving requirements (e.g., apps, AI models, healthcare platforms).</p>
<p><b>Key characteristics:</b></p>
<p>1) Multiple development cycles or loops</p>
<p>2) Feedback-driven refinement after each iteration</p>
<p><b>MBSE advantages in iterative models:</b></p>
<p>1) Allows changes without rewriting entire documentation</p>
<p>2) Engineers can model and compare design versions easily</p>
<p>3) Simulation and feedback loops improve adaptability</p>
<p><b>Why it matters:</b></p>
<p>Digital systems must adapt to user feedback and tech changes. Iteration, supported by MBSE, ensures resilience and long-term improvement.</p>
<p><b>Incremental Life Cycle Model</b></p>
<p><b>Use case:</b></p>
<p>Modular systems (e.g., IoT platforms, SaaS tools, smart home devices).</p>
<p><b>Key characteristics:</b></p>
<p>1) Develop and deliver system parts (increments) separately</p>
<p>2) Each part adds new functionality</p>
<p><b>MBSE advantages in incremental models:</b></p>
<p>1) Components are modeled and tested independently</p>
<p>2) Ensures each addition integrates seamlessly with the system</p>
<p>3) Enables staged deployment and testing</p>
<p><b>Why it matters:</b></p>
<p>Incremental delivery keeps systems sustainable by reducing risk. MBSE maintains consistency across modules, avoiding integration problems down the line.</p>
<h3>Why Life Cycle Models Are Essential for Digital System Design</h3>
<p>Digital systems are inherently complex, dynamic, and interdependent. Life cycle models provide structure to this chaos.</p>
<p><b>They help by:</b></p>
<p><b>Supporting long-term sustainability:</b> Systems evolve over years, not weeks. Life cycle planning ensures components remain useful, secure, and interoperable.</p>
<p><b>Enabling adaptability:</b>Iterative and incremental models empower digital systems to respond to new requirements and technologies.</p>
<p><b>Reducing waste and cost:</b>Identifying failure points early in the life cycle saves resources and accelerates development.</p>
<p>Without life cycle models, digital projects risk short-sighted design, over-complexity, and eventual collapse.</p>
<h3>MBSE in Action: Case Studies</h3>
<p><b>1) NASA’s Artemis Mission</b></p>
<p>1) NASA uses MBSE to manage thousands of components across spacecraft, communication, and safety systems.</p>
<p>2) Real-time modeling helps simulate interactions, trace changes, and ensure mission readiness (NASA, 2023).</p>
<p><b>2) Siemens Digital Industries</b></p>
<p>1) Siemens adopted MBSE for industrial automation.</p>
<p>2) Result: 30% reduction in testing time and faster market delivery, with better compliance across international markets (Siemens, 2022).</p>
<p><b>Top Benefits of MBSE for Digital Systems</b></p>
<p>1) Here’s a recap of how MBSE boosts design, sustainability, and system evolution:</p>
<p><b>Real-time updates:</b>No more outdated documents.</p>
<p><b>Simulation & validation:</b>Spot errors before production.</p>
<p><b>Traceability:</b>Track every change from requirement to deployment.</p>
<p><b>Cross-functional collaboration:</b>One model, many perspectives.</p>
<p><b>Scalability:</b>Models evolve with the system.</p>


            <h3>Conclusion</h3> 
            <p><b>The Future Belongs to Systems Thinkers</b></p>
            <p>In a rapidly changing world, complexity is inevitable. Systems thinking helps engineers frame problems wisely, and MBSE gives them the tools to build resilient, intelligent systems.</p>
            <p>When combined with robust life cycle models, MBSE transforms digital systems into adaptive, scalable, and sustainable assets. It’s not just about avoiding failure—it’s about building for the future.</p>
            <p>The next generation of digital engineers won’t just be coders or designers. They’ll be systems thinkers, ready to connect dots, manage complexity, and lead innovation.</p>

                </head>
                <body>
                
                    <h1>Human First: Designing with Empathy, Perception, and Usability in Mind</h1>
                
                    <p><strong>Design is about people,</strong> not just color schemes, wireframes, or visual appeal. Human-Centered Design (HCD), a process that centers every design decision around the needs, objectives, and context of the user, is at the foundation of effective digital systems. HCD is a way of thinking that asks designers to see the world from their users' point of view.</p>
                
                    <h2>Understanding Human-Centered Design</h2>
                
                    <p><strong>Empathy is the cornerstone</strong> of human-centered design. The idea is the same whether using the ISO 9241-210 framework or the Field Guide from IDEO.org, knowing the user's experience leads to effective design.</p>
                
                    <p>In order to bring human aspects into system development, the ISO 9241-210 standard describes a six-step cycle that starts with planning and context research, continues with solution evaluation, and ends when user demands are met. This model's versatility, its capacity to accommodate both quick and conventional approaches while requiring ongoing user participation throughout the design process, is what makes it unique.</p>
                
                    <p>In the meanwhile, design is approached via the understandings of co-creation, empathy, optimism, and iteration in IDEO's Field Guide to Human-Centered Design. It presents seven mindsets—from "embracing ambiguity" to "learning from failure" and "making it", that enable designers to interact meaningfully with users (IDEO). These principles emphasize the significance of early testing, real-world observation of people in real-world situations, and flexibility.</p>
                
                    <p><strong>The message is apparent in both models:</strong> meaningful design is impossible without empathy and involvement. "<a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/empathy-mapping/" target="_blank">Empathy mapping</a> helps visualize user attitudes and behaviors to align team perspectives and ensure that design decisions are rooted in genuine user needs," according to Gibbons (2018) of the Nielsen Norman Group.</p>
                
                    <p>Together with these models, new developments in user experience tools have promoted the systematic use of HCD concepts. For example, designers can obtain real-time input from a variety of consumers by using usability testing platforms such as Maze and Optimal Workshop. With the help of these technologies, even small teams can integrate user validation and iterative design processes into limited project deadlines, making HCD more accessible and scalable than ever.</p>
                
                    <p>Furthermore, by adding reliability and structure to IDEO's model, ISO 9241-210 makes sure that no stage of the procedure is missed. While remaining adaptable to many processes, including quick cycles and conventional project schedules, it supports creativity in accountability and usability requirements. It is essential to combine structure and creativity in order to find a balance between innovation and sustainability.</p>
                
                    <p>Furthermore, reading is a taught action that can be affected by poor design. In order to serve users of different literacy levels and visual talents, Johnson stresses the significance of selecting proper font sizes, contrast, spacing, and alignment. By minimizing long text passages, emphasizing key information, and using headers and bullet points to make navigation simpler, designers can reduce psychological burden.</p>
                
                    <h2>Designing with Perception in Mind</h2>
                
                    <p><strong>Empathy isn't enough on its own.</strong> Additionally, designers need to be aware of how people view and use digital interfaces. According to Jeff Johnson's book <em>Designing with the Mind in Mind</em>, usability is influenced by fundamental psychological concepts such as perception, attention, and memory.</p>
                
                    <p>The emotional impact of images is another visual element that is often overlooked. Images can inspire comfort, urgency, or trust and are effective meaning-conveyors. Including real, varied images that represent the user base not only improves inclusion but also creates emotional bonds. For instance, in healthcare apps, showcasing a varied range of patients and providers promotes relatability and lowers interaction anxiety. User engagement is often aided by emotional design, particularly where confidence and trust are needed.</p>
                
                    <p>According to Johnson, context, previous experiences, and present objectives all influence how users perceive what they anticipate. Errors and confusion rise when visual layouts depart from well-known structures. Task flow can be disrupted, for instance, by employing an unfamiliar icon or positioning a "submit" button in an unusual place (Johnson, 2020). In addition to improving learnability, consistent interface design lowers psychological burden.</p>
                
                    <p>Furthermore, users glance rather than read. This emphasizes how important a clear visual hierarchy is. Categories and functions within a layout are easier for users to understand when principles like accessibility, similarity, and closure are applied. Gestalt psychology underscores these ideas, which assist designers in creating interfaces that match user expectations with visual structure.</p>
                
                    <h2>UX Laws in Practice</h2>
                
                    <p>Designers frequently use well-established UX laws, which define expected human behavior in digital contexts, to further improve usability. These rules offer helpful direction for early design choices that improve user experience rather than hinder from it.</p>
                
                    <p><strong>Jakob’s Law</strong> states that Users prefer interfaces that perform similarly to those they have previously used. Users prefer interfaces that perform similarly to those they have previously used, according to Jakob's Law. This indicates that utilizing standard design elements, such as a search icon in the upper right corner or mobile swipe gestures, not only improves usability but also lessens annoyance (<a href="https://cdn.oujdalibrary.com/books/591/591-laws-of-ux-design-principles-for-persuasive-and-ethical-products-(www.tawcer.com).pdf" target="_blank">Yablonski, 2020</a>). The main reason Snapchat's 2018 redesign failed was because it diverged from these norms, which outraged users.</p>
                
                    <p><strong>According to Fitts' Law,</strong> a user interface element's size and distance determine how long it takes to interact with it. Important buttons, such as "submit" and "delete," should therefore be sufficiently large and accessible, particularly on mobile devices (Yablonski, 2020). For instance, Tesla's touchscreen design puts frequently used functions within easy reach to increase productivity and safety.</p>
                
                    <p><strong>Hick's Law</strong> highlights how having too many options causes decision-making to be delayed. It's preferable to keep things simple. Imagine Google's simple homepage, which consists of just two buttons and a search box.</p>
                
                    <p><strong>According to Miller's Law,</strong> most people can only remember seven plus or minus two things at a time. Reading tactics, such as grouping relevant elements together, utilizing whitespace, and arranging menus into logical parts, are used in effective interfaces. For this reason, phone numbers are structured (123-456-7890, for example) to make them easier to remember.</p>
                
                    <p>These laws are useful instruments that assist in translating human psychology into significant digital experiences. Although basic interface design is guided by these laws, its application requires context. Miller's Law, for instance, can suggest breaking up content into reasonable portions, but the type of content is important. While an academic site could need more specific alternatives for relevance, an e-commerce platform might profit from having fewer product categories. Therefore, rather than being set rules, UX laws should be viewed as flexible suggestions.</p>

                <title>Empathy, Perception, and Attention</title>
               </head>
               <body>
               
                   <h1>Empathy, Perception, and Attention</h1>
               
                   <p><strong>One concept unites all of these ideas:</strong> design must be functional for people. Early design choices, such as button placement, labeling, or style, may improve or break usability, whether you're creating a simple web page or a full-scale program. Overly abstract iconography, too many alternatives, or misaligned visual cues can make users pause or stop working on a task completely.</p>
               
                   <p><strong>Supporting mental and emotional well-being</strong> is another important function of design. Dark mode, less motion toggles, or relaxing color schemes are examples of features that can increase accessibility for people with anxiety disorders or sensory sensitivity. Early consideration of these issues during the design phase allows teams to show greater empathy and increase their user base by making thoughtful accommodations.</p>
               
                   <p><strong>Also, excellent design considers the demands of the user.</strong> It recognizes human limitations, clears misunderstandings, and directs attention to important actions. Above all, it emphasizes empathy as a daily design mindset, not only in user testing or surveys.</p>
               
                   <h2>Diversity, Context, and Culture</h2>
               
                   <p><strong>Cultural sensitivity</strong> is another important but frequently disregarded component of human-centered design. Cultural differences can greatly affect how colors, icons, and even interface metaphors (such as a "trash bin") are understood. Diversity in skills, reading levels, device access, and digital proficiency are all taken into account in a fully inclusive design process, in addition to user demographics. Designing for accessibility improves usability for everyone, not only those with disabilities, claims <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/" target="_blank">W3C's Web Accessibility Initiative</a> (W3C, 2024).</p>
               
                   <p>With the ongoing globalization of digital experiences, designers now need to think about translation and localization techniques. In East Asian or Middle Eastern cultures, a term, symbol, or arrangement that works well in the United States might not have the same meaning. The design strategy has to consider local rules and regulations, regional accessibility standards, and left-to-right versus right-to-left reading directions from the very start.</p>
               
                   <p><strong>Lastly, context is equally important.</strong> When using an app under a high-stress scenario (such as emergency response), a user's behavior will differ from that of a person using a social network while sitting on their couch. The interaction must be shaped by human-centered designers who are aware of the user's emotional, technological, and environmental surroundings.</p>
               
                   <h2>Designing for the Extreme Situations</h2>
               
                   <p><strong>Product teams frequently concentrate on the "average user,"</strong> but designing for rare circumstances promotes creativity and inclusivity. These include older users, people with physical disabilities, and users who use platforms with inadequate connectivity. While targeting a specific group, Microsoft's design solutions for the Xbox Adaptive Controller also had an impact on more general accessibility standards (Manjoo, 2018). Designing for extreme scenarios improves ethical design, expands market reach, and breaks down systemic obstacles.</p>
               
                   <h2>Testing and Feedback</h2>
               
                   <p><strong>Iteration is another essential element</strong> of both the ISO and IDEO approaches. Whether they are digital models or paper designs, prototypes provide quick learning. Frequent testing helps identify trouble spots early rather than waiting until a product is "finished" to involve users.</p>
               
                   <p>"Failing early to succeed sooner" is emphasized by <a href="https://design-kit-production.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Field_Guides/Field+Guide+to+Human-Centered+Design_IDEOorg_English.pdf?utf8=%E2%9C%93&_method=patch&authenticity_token=QZRbnzBBPY3M%2FCd3xeDx424iAXgVkgcTAi74f6cW4pU%3D&resource%5Btitle%5D=&resource%5Bsubtitle%5D=&resource%5Bauthor%5D=&resource%5Babout%5D=" target="_blank">IDEO.org's Field Guide</a>, which is consistent with adaptable development's acceptance of feedback systems. Testing usability is a constant procedure rather than a one-time event. Improvements should be based on each round of feedback. And not only from end users, stakeholders, developers, and subject matter experts can all provide insightful viewpoints.</p>
               
                   <h2>Conclusion: Designing for People, Not Just Screens</h2>
               
                   <p><strong>We acknowledge the entire range of human experience</strong>—how we see, choose, feel, and remember—when we "design for people." Human-Centered Design is a dedication to compassion, curiosity, and iteration rather than a list of requirements.</p>
               
                   <p>It is not just our duty as designers to find solutions to issues, but also to do so with consideration for those affected. With the help of fundamental UX rules, IDEO's compassionate approach, and a grasp of perception and the ISO 9241-210 framework, we can design systems that are not just useful but also genuinely human-first.</p>
