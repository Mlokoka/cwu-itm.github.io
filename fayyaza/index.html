            <h3>Designing for the Long Haul: Life Cycle Thinking in Systems Engineering</h3>
            <p>In today’s digital and interconnected world, engineering systems demand more than just technical expertise or the creation of functional products. Successful systems engineering is about managing complexity, anticipating system evolution, and designing with long-term value and adaptability in mind. At the core of this philosophy lies the Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC)—a structured methodology that enables engineers to manage each stage of a system’s journey, from initial planning to eventual decommissioning.</p>

<p>This blog post explores the SDLC and takes a deeper look into three core life cycle models: linear, iterative, and incremental. These models shape how engineers approach development and decision-making over time. The post also integrates systems thinking, Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE), and human-centered design principles—drawing on Jeff Johnson’s <em>Designing with the Mind in Mind</em>—to show how user needs and system longevity are both critical to effective engineering.</p>

<h3>Understanding the Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC)</h3>
<p>The SDLC provides a framework for developing and managing systems through distinct phases: concept development, requirements gathering, system design, implementation, testing, deployment, operation, maintenance, and retirement (INCOSE, 2015). These stages ensure a holistic view—incorporating not just the technical aspects of a system, but also human, financial, and operational considerations throughout its lifespan.</p>

<h3>Systems Thinking: A Holistic Engineering Perspective</h3>
<p>Systems thinking encourages engineers to understand the dynamic relationships between components within a system. It highlights how local decisions can influence broader system behavior. According to <em>Systems Engineering Demystified</em> (n.d.), this mindset shifts focus from isolated problem-solving to viewing systems as interconnected wholes that interact with their users and environments.</p>

<h3>Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE)</h3>
<p>MBSE replaces static documents with interactive, digital models that improve communication, traceability, and early validation (INCOSE, 2015). These models are particularly effective in life cycle models like iterative and incremental, where requirements and solutions evolve through feedback loops and stakeholder engagement.</p>

<h3>Human-Centered Design: Learning from Cognitive Psychology</h3>
<p>Jeff Johnson (2020) stresses that many system usability failures occur when design ignores how people perceive, think, and behave. Human-centered design, grounded in cognitive psychology, aims to align system behavior with mental models, reduce cognitive load, and create intuitive experiences. Involving users early and consistently helps produce systems that are both efficient and user-friendly.</p>

<h3>Comparing Life Cycle Models</h3>
<p>Choosing the right development model can significantly affect system success. Each life cycle model offers unique strengths and limitations depending on the project context, complexity, and level of requirement uncertainty.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Linear (Waterfall Model):</strong> This model follows a strict, sequential order of phases. It is best suited for projects with well-defined, stable requirements—such as government systems or infrastructure projects—where major changes during development are not expected. However, the linear model is inflexible and offers little opportunity to revisit earlier phases once they’re completed, which can lead to inefficiencies if problems emerge late in the process.</li>

  <li><strong>Iterative Model:</strong> The iterative model embraces uncertainty by cycling through repeated phases of development and refinement. Each iteration produces a prototype that can be evaluated and improved. This approach is useful when requirements are unclear or evolving, such as in machine learning systems or UX-intensive applications. It enables continuous stakeholder feedback and aligns well with MBSE, which supports visual modeling and refinement throughout iterations.</li>

  <li><strong>Incremental Model:</strong> In this model, the system is built and delivered in smaller components, or increments. Each part adds to the previous one, offering partial functionality early and allowing for ongoing testing and user validation. It's ideal for modular systems, such as enterprise software or mobile apps, where risk can be minimized by validating key features before the full system is delivered.</li>
</ul>

<p>In today’s practice, many engineering teams use hybrid models that combine elements of iterative and incremental approaches—like Agile frameworks. These allow for adaptability, continuous delivery, and rapid response to change. Ultimately, life cycle thinking requires choosing or tailoring a model not just based on technical goals, but also on user needs, stakeholder engagement, and long-term maintainability.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>By understanding and applying principles from systems thinking, MBSE, and user-centered design, engineers can design systems that are robust, sustainable, and adaptable. Whether applying a linear, iterative, or incremental model, the key is to select the approach that best supports flexibility, system longevity, and stakeholder alignment. A thoughtful life cycle strategy transforms engineering from short-term implementation to long-term system stewardship.</p>

            <h2>Designing to Meet Human Needs: The Importance of Perception, Empathy, and Usability</h2>
          </header>
         <article>
            <h2>Designing to Meet Human Needs: The Importance of Perception, Empathy, and Usability</h2>
          
            <p>What does it take to design in a way that serves people? This question, though it sounds straightforward, forms the core of human-centered design, or HCD. This approach builds on empathy, repeated testing, and understanding users. As digital interactions define more of our daily lives, designers have a bigger responsibility to match design and usability with how people think, feel, and act.</p>
          
            <p>Design goes beyond making things look nice—it focuses on solving real issues for real users. This post looks at how human-centered design methods, like those in <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/52075.html" target="_blank">ISO 9241-210</a> and <a href="https://www.designkit.org/resources/1" target="_blank">IDEO’s Field Guide</a>, work together and how ideas about perception and attention, plus foundational UX laws, help us build designs that are clear, open to everyone, and work well.</p>
          
            <h3>Human-Centered Design: Building Empathy into Solutions</h3>
            <p>Human-centered design uses a problem-solving approach that keeps the goals, needs, and limits of users in focus at every step. It doesn’t just mean testing a product after it’s finished. It means including user input all along the way.</p>
          
            <p>The <a href="https://www.designkit.org/resources/1" target="_blank">IDEO Field Guide to Human-Centered Design</a> highlights ideas like empathy, optimism, and learning through trial and error. According to IDEO, HCD is built on the belief “that all problems are solvable” and that the people most affected by a problem often hold the answers (IDEO.org, 2015).</p>
          
            <p><a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/52075.html" target="_blank">ISO 9241-210</a> lays out a clear framework to follow. Its process includes six steps: planning, analyzing context, defining requirements, creating design solutions, testing them, and repeating as needed. This approach helps apply usability principles in an organized way (DIN, 2019).</p>
          
            <h3>Seeing and Thinking: Perception, Attention, and the Interface</h3>
            <p>User perception makes or breaks interface design. The way users look at interfaces, how their brains sort through details, and the shifts in their focus all affect whether a design works or not.</p>
          
            <p>Perception controls what users notice first. Attention decides what they take in. A designer’s job is to guide users’ focus while keeping it simple enough for their minds to handle. Using visual hierarchy is one way to do this. It lays out elements to show their importance. A good example is a call-to-action button. Designers use color contrast, size, and easy-to-spot placement to grab attention.</p>
          
            <p>A weak visual hierarchy creates confusion for the mind. Users spend time searching instead of recognizing. The interface fails to guide and ends up causing frustration. Designers who grasp how people perceive things can create natural and almost invisible experiences.</p>
          
            <p>These design decisions work within what the human mind can handle. Our brains work but follow certain biases. Knowing this can help in building interactions that feel easy and intuitive.</p>
          
            <h3>Key UX Laws: Jakob's, Fitts's, Hick's, and Miller's</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Jakob’s Law:</strong> Users prefer familiar interfaces. For example, placing the shopping cart in the top-right corner of an online store follows expectations (Nielsen, 2000).</li>
              <li><strong>Fitts’s Law:</strong> Larger buttons placed near focal areas are easier to use, especially on mobile devices (DIN, 2019).</li>
              <li><strong>Hick’s Law:</strong> Fewer options speed up decision-making. Designers should limit choices on-screen to avoid cognitive overload.</li>
              <li><strong>Miller’s Law:</strong> People can hold 7±2 items in memory at once. Chunking and grouping helps users navigate more easily.</li>
            </ul>
          
            <h3>Empathy in Design: A Subtle Force</h3>
            <p>Cognitive rules shape design, but empathy drives its human touch. IDEO starts creating by diving deep into users' experiences. They watch, hear personal stories, and learn about the surroundings. This is not casual observation but a core step in gathering key insights.</p>
          
            <p>ISO 9241-210 explains this method by focusing on specifying context and refining ideas step by step. Designers need to involve users at every stage, not just after the design is done. The main aim is to make sure the design fits what users need.</p>
          
            <p>Empathy helps designers move past just making things usable. It pushes them to build experiences that matter. It stops the idea of designing for people and moves towards designing alongside them.</p>
          
            <h3>Example: A Public Health App</h3>
            <p>Imagine a mobile app made to help parents in low-income areas keep track of their kids’ vaccinations. A team following ISO 9241-210 starts by studying the environment users are in, like shared phones, low familiarity with technology, and unreliable internet access.</p>
          
            <p>IDEO suggests holding co-creation workshops in local community spaces and using simple paper prototypes to check ideas. Fitts's Law encourages creating big, easy-to-tap icons. Miller’s Law helps teams to design interfaces that focus on no more than five main actions on a single screen.</p>
          
            <p>Empathy shapes the way content is created. Visuals replace long or difficult text to make things clear. Testing ideas with users makes sure the app feels reliable and valuable instead of just another download.</p>
          
            <p>This approach builds more than just a usable tool. It builds trust and makes people feel included—key aspects of thoughtful human-centered design.</p>
          
            <h3>Final Thought: Design With People, Not Just for Them</h3>
            <p>Creating designs that work for people means recognizing that great design stems from understanding human behavior and constant feedback. The ISO 9241-210 framework provides structure, and IDEO's Field Guide brings creativity and a human-centered approach. Together, these tools emphasize that users are not barriers to design but the purpose behind it.</p>
          
            <p>When we study how perception and attention shape experiences and apply UX principles based on human constraints, we make designs that are clear, effective, and considerate. Starting with empathy pushes us past just making things usable—it allows us to craft solutions that connect with others.</p>
          
            <p>Design's future focuses on people, not screens. The most meaningful designs let people feel valued, understood, and empowered.</p>

            <h2>Module 2.2 Blog Post: Thinking with the Interface</h2>
          </header>
        
          <section class="article-body">
            <p>Good design doesn’t just look appealing—it supports the way users think, act, and remember. Interfaces aren’t just tools; they are cognitive environments that either help or hinder users in completing tasks efficiently. With increasing complexity in digital systems, understanding the relationship between human cognition and interface design is crucial. This blog post will explore how memory, mental models, feedback, and consistency contribute to usability, and how poor designs can impose unnecessary cognitive load.</p>
        
            <h3>Mental Models and Memory</h3>
            <p>When users interact with an interface, they rely on what are known as mental models—internal representations of how they believe a system should work. These models are formed from prior experiences with other systems and inform expectations. For example, when using a new email client, users expect to find a 'compose' button somewhere at the top left or right, because that’s where it is in Gmail, Outlook, and Yahoo. Breaking from this expectation confuses users.</p>
            <p>Memory also plays a vital role. According to George Miller’s law, our working memory can only retain about 7±2 items at once. Designers must therefore avoid interfaces that require users to remember information across multiple steps. In <em>Designing with the Mind in Mind</em>, Johnson (2020) highlights how recognition-based interfaces outperform recall-based ones. Recognizing icons, options, or paths significantly lowers mental strain compared to remembering exact commands or steps.</p>
            <p>Amazon’s 1-click ordering exemplifies this principle. Once users associate the button with a successful transaction, they mentally model that action as trustworthy. No lengthy forms or repeated confirmations are required—just a single, predictable action. This reduces memory burden and streamlines the decision-making process.</p>
        
            <figure>
              <img src="images/feedback.jpg" alt="Thumbs up and down in speech bubbles representing user feedback." width="600">
              <figcaption>Clear visual cues (like thumbs up/down) reinforce user confidence through immediate feedback.</figcaption>
            </figure>
        
            <h3>Consistency and Feedback</h3>
            <p>One of the most effective ways to reduce cognitive load is through consistency. Jakob’s Law, discussed in <em>The Laws of UX</em> (Babich, 2019), states that users prefer your site to function like other familiar platforms. When layouts, colors, or labels change arbitrarily, users are forced to relearn patterns, increasing the likelihood of errors and abandonment.</p>
            <p>Feedback, on the other hand, provides immediate reassurance. Systems that respond to user actions—through animations, messages, or sound—help users feel in control. Consider Google Docs: when you type, a “Saving…” message appears, followed by “All changes saved.” This micro-interaction prevents user anxiety about data loss and improves overall satisfaction.</p>
            <p>Compare that to a multi-step web form that, upon pressing "Submit", erases all data and provides no error message if something was filled incorrectly. Users feel frustrated, not only because their time was wasted, but because the system failed to communicate.</p>
        
            <h3>Recognition vs. Recall</h3>
            <p>Another foundational cognitive principle in UX is the distinction between recognition and recall. Recognition is passive and triggered by external cues, whereas recall requires active memory retrieval. Interfaces should rely more on the former.</p>
            <p>Consider the difference between typing a command into a terminal versus clicking an icon on a GUI. The latter is more user-friendly for the average person. Spotify, for example, uses clearly labeled icons and playlist thumbnails. If users had to recall exact artist names or song titles without suggestions or images, the app would be far less usable.</p>
            <p>Well-designed interfaces also offer visual continuity. Netflix, for instance, displays previously watched episodes, recommendations, and progress bars. Users are guided through their experience based on what they see—not what they have to remember.</p>
        
            <figure>
              <img src="images/frustrated.jpg" alt="Frustrated user with question marks and charts floating above." width="600">
              <figcaption>When mental effort exceeds our cognitive limit, frustration and failure quickly follow.</figcaption>
            </figure>
        
            <h3>Cognitive Load and Tesler’s Law</h3>
            <p>Cognitive load is the mental effort required to use a system. Designs that reduce unnecessary choices or ambiguity are more effective. Tesler’s Law tells us that "every application has an inherent amount of complexity. The job of the designer is to manage it."</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, many systems shift this complexity onto users. Airline booking forms often ask for seating preferences, fare class, loyalty numbers, and insurance details—before showing available flights. This overloads users at the wrong time. A better approach would sequence these steps and reduce the visible fields at each stage, like what Hopper or Skyscanner do.</p>
            <p>Duolingo illustrates good practice by letting learners make one choice at a time. Each lesson builds on past lessons, reinforcing learning without overwhelming. The interface uses bright icons, progress indicators, and encouraging messages. These combine to reduce mental strain while reinforcing motivation.</p>
        
            <h3>Good Design in Practice</h3>
            <p>The CarPoolin app interface below is a model of minimal cognitive load. First, the home screen uses friendly imagery that immediately communicates its purpose: travel and savings. Next, users are guided step-by-step—from selecting destination, date, to passenger count. Each action is visual, intuitive, and consistent with mobile norms.</p>
        
            <figure>
              <img src="images/ui.jpg" alt="Minimalist mobile UI with clear flow and buttons." width="600">

              <figcaption>A clean UI with minimal cognitive load: clear goals, logical sequence, and immediate feedback.</figcaption>
            </figure>
        
            <p>This design aligns perfectly with users’ mental models of ride-sharing and travel booking apps. It avoids redundant fields, reduces the need for typing, and provides immediate feedback through button states and confirmations. More importantly, it respects the user's time and attention—two of the most valuable digital currencies today.</p>
            <p>Compare this to a cluttered interface with dropdowns hidden under tabs, unclear icons, and no error recovery. Every misstep costs attention and patience. A well-designed interface is silent—it simply works.</p>
        
            <h3>Case Study: Poor Design and High Cognitive Load</h3>
            <p>Consider the user experience of an older tax filing system used in many countries before modernization efforts. The interface was filled with jargon, no tooltips, no inline validation, and mandatory multi-page forms that didn’t save progress. Users were expected to calculate deductions manually, understand legal tax language, and format values precisely to avoid rejection.</p>
            <p>This system not only violated best practices but ignored Tesler’s Law entirely. Complexity was dumped onto the user. The resulting experience was one of anxiety, confusion, and frequent errors. Redesigns of these systems now include guided flows, help text, autocomplete, and live chat support—features that recognize user limitations and ease mental effort.</p>
        
            <h3>Designing for Accessibility and Cognitive Differences</h3>
            <p>Designing with cognition in mind is especially vital for users with ADHD, dyslexia, or age-related cognitive decline. A design that minimizes distractions, uses predictable layouts, and offers progressive disclosure (showing information as needed) can dramatically improve usability for these groups.</p>
            <p>For example, Apple's iOS “Focus” mode and interface simplifications benefit not only neurodivergent users but everyone. Similarly, readable fonts, ample spacing, and avoidance of scrolling text improve comprehension. These aren’t just ethical considerations—they enhance performance and satisfaction across all user types.</p>
            <p>Inclusive design respects the diversity of human cognition and acknowledges that everyone benefits when systems are clear, predictable, and accommodating. As Norman (2013) argued, design should be for how people actually behave—not how we wish they behaved.</p>
        
            <h3>Future Directions: Cognitive Design in the Age of AI</h3>
            <p>As artificial intelligence becomes increasingly embedded in everyday interfaces—from voice assistants to recommendation engines—understanding user cognition is more important than ever. Systems now adapt to users in real time, but poor cognitive alignment can lead to confusion and loss of trust.</p>
            <p>Consider AI chatbots: if their responses lack transparency or fail to reflect users' mental models of a helpful assistant, users may abandon them quickly. Similarly, algorithmic recommendation systems (like those on YouTube or Netflix) need to strike a balance between novelty and familiarity. Too much change disrupts consistency; too little feels stale.</p>
            <p>Emerging trends in UX include adaptive interfaces, context-aware simplification, and emotion-sensing feedback loops. These aim to align system behavior even more closely with how humans perceive, decide, and remember. But the fundamentals remain the same—respect memory limits, reduce load, and build around real mental models.</p>
        
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Design is not just about aesthetics—it's about empathy. It’s about knowing that your user is a human with limited time, limited memory, and a desire for clarity. By embracing cognitive principles like recognition over recall, consistent structure, immediate feedback, and minimizing unnecessary load, designers can create systems that feel intuitive and delightful.</p>
            <p>Tesler’s Law reminds us: complexity exists, but it’s our job to manage it—not pass it on to the user. From tax systems to mobile apps, and from accessibility to AI, design should meet users where they are—supporting, guiding, and never overwhelming. Cognitive-based design is not just smart UX—it’s human-centered thinking at its best.</p>
