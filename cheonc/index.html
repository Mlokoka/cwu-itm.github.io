            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>Today's era of hyper connection and speed is giving us more complex systems than ever everything from intelligent cities and driverless cars to cloud-native applications and connected health. Not just are these systems technologically more sophisticated, but they are embedded in intricate social, regulatory, and environmental contexts as well. Consequently, traditional engineering practices reliant on linear logic and document dense methodologies are not keeping up. This is where model-based systems engineering (MBSE) and systems thinking comes in and are surfacing as impactful, complementary methods that allow problem solvers and engineers to deal with complexity. This article explores how MBSE and systems thinking allow us to have an integrated, responsive, and a sustainable way of engineering. They are not mere processes, but rather an example, one that allows us to leave behind on the spot problem-solving and instead create active, collaborative, and impact solutions. </p>
            <h3>System Thinking and MBSE</h3>
            <p>Systems thinking is a systems-based analysis methodology that focuses on how components of a system engage with each other and how systems function over time and within larger systems. You could say this system has existed since the beginning of mankind's creation of systems in general and becoming more of a common term and getting acknowledged in the 20th century, more specifically in the 1960s. At its essence, systems thinking accepts important principles such as feedback cycles, cause and effect, and emergent action phenomena that could not be learned by examining bits and pieces of the system. For example, optimizing traffic throughput in a metropolitan area isn't merely a function of adding highways; it entails studying public transport availability, commute patterns, urban planning regulations, and even the algorithms used to pair ride-partners. It's a dynamic system with interrelatedness and indirect effects.</p>
            <p>In the reading of Systems Engineering Demystified, Jon Holt emphasizes complexity quite often and that systems thinking is a practical way in handling the complexity that often occurs. He also mentions communication and understanding quite often as well which together these three were named Three Evils of System of Engineering. This is a systems theory view, where components can be explained only in terms of their relationship to one another, not in isolation (Holt, 2023). Holt’s first chapter talks about these quite heavily and even is seen in the second chapter. These hold true for professionals and even students, systems thinking evokes a critical self-awareness. It tries to have us tackle all these issues.</p>
            <p>Consider the aerospace industry, where systems are notoriously intricate and safety critical. NASA, for example, employed MBSE in the design and integration of its Artemis lunar missions. Models allowed engineers to simulate interactions between propulsion, navigation, communication, and environmental subsystems documenting potential failures before physical prototyping. According to NASA, using integrated models across subsystems improves reuse, evaluation speed, and overall system understanding—particularly for high-stakes space exploration initiatives (NASA, 2021). This saved costs significantly, improved reliability, and sped up cross-departmental collaboration. NASA is just one example of MBSE being adopted industry-wide automotive, defense, telecom, and even medical where systems must change fast but retain interoperability and regulatory compliance. This shows the worth and versatility of MBSE and system thinking in these environments.</p>
            <h3>Synergy and SysML</h3>
            <p>Where systems thinking provides us with the conceptual structure, Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) provides us with the tools to execute on that structure. MBSE replaces outdated, document-based approaches with formal models capturing the structure, behavior, requirements, and constraints of a system. This makes MBSE and systems engineering possibly feel like their own categories. This is not true, and their strengths are important especially when they paired together. Systems thinking determines what we need to know the dynamic complexity, patterns, and larger context. MBSE determines how we communicate and maintain that knowledge using established, flexible models. </p>
            <p>One of these is something called SysML (Systems Modeling Language). According to an article I found and read SysML is “It provides a visual language for representing complex systems, including their structure, behavior, and information flows. SysML is derived from the Unified Modeling Language (UML) but tailored specifically for systems engineering needs.” (Zuken, 2024). Implementing this and any others I have not mentioned has the ability to help organizations be more efficient, reliable, and effective in their outcomes.</p>
            <p>A practical smart building system may involve user behavior, weather data, energy efficiency requirements, and automation rules. Systems thinking ensures you consider the whole context; MBSE (via SysML) enables you to break it down into views, simulate behavior, and validate your design versus all functional and stakeholder requirements. Together, these techniques enable transparency, flexibility, and stakeholder alignment across all phases: from idea to retirement.</p>
            <h3>Challenges</h3>
            <p>While useful, MBSE and systems thinking have their drawbacks. To begin with, they both offer a steep learning curve and how they are having to integrate the systems without ruining workplace systems and cultural systems. Models are as good as the inputs, assumptions, and data that fuel them. Poorly designed models can mislead rather than inform. There is also the risk of model over-reliance where teams become more interested in maintaining models whole rather than engaging with real feedback. This is all somewhat solvable but is heavily reliant on the people working behind the implementation.</p>
            <p>Another issue being seen is the maintenance of the models as this is constantly changing technology quickly develops which also affects system thinking together. Finally, compatibility will proceed to be another issue because there is so many methods and systems that are useful or may feel needed, but as mentioned above the people who work to implement and work out the smaller issues is really the deciding factor in MBSE and system thinking working well.</p>
            <h3>Personal Thoughts</h3>
            <p>As I have continued to learn about system thinking and MBSE, I have remarkably changed in the way I approach problems since I wanted to absorb useful information even at a base level. I tend to narrow my thought process and now I look for the whole problem/system to understand the issue. The major thing is understanding the Three Evils I learned from Holt and how this does not only apply to this topic, but also how it can apply to almost any system related in real life and while I most likely will not fully dive into using these in most real life situations, even having the thought process in the back of my mind is important as well. The value of abstraction was quite fundamental as well in reshaping how I wanted to approach these problems. I am glad to learn and try to continuously understand these concepts as a student because system thinking and MBSE will continue to be a common part of the tech world, and I need to be prepared to face these in the future.</p>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>MBSE and system thinking are extremely important and relevant because of the sheer amount of improvement they have when implemented correctly which makes sense because of the difficulty in being able to properly understand and implement them are so important which shows their worth afterwards. By embracing systems thinking, we shift our minds from linear problem-solving to pattern recognition and design in wholes. By using MBSE, we then possess the ability to translate that mindset into models that drive clarity, agility, and collaboration. To make systems smarter, safer, and more sustainable, we must shift from managing pieces to understanding wholes. The quicker we embrace that transition, the more we'll be ready to make the future efficient, yes, but impactful as well.</p>
