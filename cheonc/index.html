            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>Today's era of hyper connection and speed is giving us more complex systems than ever everything from intelligent cities and driverless cars to cloud-native applications and connected health. Not just are these systems technologically more sophisticated, but they are embedded in intricate social, regulatory, and environmental contexts as well. Consequently, traditional engineering practices reliant on linear logic and document dense methodologies are not keeping up. This is where model-based systems engineering (MBSE) and systems thinking comes in and are surfacing as impactful, complementary methods that allow problem solvers and engineers to deal with complexity. This article explores how MBSE and systems thinking allow us to have an integrated, responsive, and a sustainable way of engineering. They are not mere processes, but rather an example, one that allows us to leave behind on the spot problem-solving and instead create active, collaborative, and impact solutions. </p>
            <h3>System Thinking and MBSE</h3>
            <p>Systems thinking is a systems-based analysis methodology that focuses on how components of a system engage with each other and how systems function over time and within larger systems. You could say this system has existed since the beginning of mankind's creation of systems in general and becoming more of a common term and getting acknowledged in the 20th century, more specifically in the 1960s. At its essence, systems thinking accepts important principles such as feedback cycles, cause and effect, and emergent action phenomena that could not be learned by examining bits and pieces of the system. For example, optimizing traffic throughput in a metropolitan area isn't merely a function of adding highways; it entails studying public transport availability, commute patterns, urban planning regulations, and even the algorithms used to pair ride-partners. It's a dynamic system with interrelatedness and indirect effects.</p>
            <p>In the reading of Systems Engineering Demystified, Jon Holt emphasizes complexity quite often and that systems thinking is a practical way in handling the complexity that often occurs. He also mentions communication and understanding quite often as well which together these three were named Three Evils of System of Engineering. This is a systems theory view, where components can be explained only in terms of their relationship to one another, not in isolation (Holt, 2023). Holt’s first chapter talks about these quite heavily and even is seen in the second chapter. These hold true for professionals and even students, systems thinking evokes a critical self-awareness. It tries to have us tackle all these issues.</p>
            <p>Consider the aerospace industry, where systems are notoriously intricate and safety critical. NASA, for example, employed MBSE in the design and integration of its Artemis lunar missions. Models allowed engineers to simulate interactions between propulsion, navigation, communication, and environmental subsystems documenting potential failures before physical prototyping. According to NASA, using integrated models across subsystems improves reuse, evaluation speed, and overall system understanding—particularly for high-stakes space exploration initiatives (NASA, 2021). This saved costs significantly, improved reliability, and sped up cross-departmental collaboration. NASA is just one example of MBSE being adopted industry-wide automotive, defense, telecom, and even medical where systems must change fast but retain interoperability and regulatory compliance. This shows the worth and versatility of MBSE and system thinking in these environments.</p>
            <h3>Synergy and SysML</h3>
            <p>Where systems thinking provides us with the conceptual structure, Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) provides us with the tools to execute on that structure. MBSE replaces outdated, document-based approaches with formal models capturing the structure, behavior, requirements, and constraints of a system. This makes MBSE and systems engineering possibly feel like their own categories. This is not true, and their strengths are important especially when they paired together. Systems thinking determines what we need to know the dynamic complexity, patterns, and larger context. MBSE determines how we communicate and maintain that knowledge using established, flexible models. </p>
            <p>One of these is something called SysML (Systems Modeling Language). According to an article I found and read SysML is “It provides a visual language for representing complex systems, including their structure, behavior, and information flows. SysML is derived from the Unified Modeling Language (UML) but tailored specifically for systems engineering needs.” (Zuken, 2024). Implementing this and any others I have not mentioned has the ability to help organizations be more efficient, reliable, and effective in their outcomes.</p>
            <p>A practical smart building system may involve user behavior, weather data, energy efficiency requirements, and automation rules. Systems thinking ensures you consider the whole context; MBSE (via SysML) enables you to break it down into views, simulate behavior, and validate your design versus all functional and stakeholder requirements. Together, these techniques enable transparency, flexibility, and stakeholder alignment across all phases: from idea to retirement.</p>
            <h3>Challenges</h3>
            <p>While useful, MBSE and systems thinking have their drawbacks. To begin with, they both offer a steep learning curve and how they are having to integrate the systems without ruining workplace systems and cultural systems. Models are as good as the inputs, assumptions, and data that fuel them. Poorly designed models can mislead rather than inform. There is also the risk of model over-reliance where teams become more interested in maintaining models whole rather than engaging with real feedback. This is all somewhat solvable but is heavily reliant on the people working behind the implementation.</p>
            <p>Another issue being seen is the maintenance of the models as this is constantly changing technology quickly develops which also affects system thinking together. Finally, compatibility will proceed to be another issue because there is so many methods and systems that are useful or may feel needed, but as mentioned above the people who work to implement and work out the smaller issues is really the deciding factor in MBSE and system thinking working well.</p>
            <h3>Personal Thoughts</h3>
            <p>As I have continued to learn about system thinking and MBSE, I have remarkably changed in the way I approach problems since I wanted to absorb useful information even at a base level. I tend to narrow my thought process and now I look for the whole problem/system to understand the issue. The major thing is understanding the Three Evils I learned from Holt and how this does not only apply to this topic, but also how it can apply to almost any system related in real life and while I most likely will not fully dive into using these in most real life situations, even having the thought process in the back of my mind is important as well. The value of abstraction was quite fundamental as well in reshaping how I wanted to approach these problems. I am glad to learn and try to continuously understand these concepts as a student because system thinking and MBSE will continue to be a common part of the tech world, and I need to be prepared to face these in the future.</p>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>MBSE and system thinking are extremely important and relevant because of the sheer amount of improvement they have when implemented correctly which makes sense because of the difficulty in being able to properly understand and implement them are so important which shows their worth afterwards. By embracing systems thinking, we shift our minds from linear problem-solving to pattern recognition and design in wholes. By using MBSE, we then possess the ability to translate that mindset into models that drive clarity, agility, and collaboration. To make systems smarter, safer, and more sustainable, we must shift from managing pieces to understanding wholes. The quicker we embrace that transition, the more we'll be ready to make the future efficient, yes, but impactful as well.</p>

               <h2>Module 1.2 Blog Post</h2>
            </header>
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>When we think about systems engineers, it is easy to picture people building highly technical solutions rockets, infrastructures, software platforms. But systems engineering is not about building things. It is about building the right things, in the right way, for the right reasons, and guiding them through every stage of their evolution. This strategic, life cycle focused view is the bedrock of systems thinking and the engine of model-based systems engineering. In this blog, I will talk about the concept of the systems development life cycle, compare three common life cycle models linear, iterative, and incremental and reflect on why a life cycle perspective is crucial to the sustainability and adaptability of digital systems.</p>
            <h3>Understanding Life Cycle Thinking</h3>
            <p>The system's engineering life cycle is a structured framework that outlines the stages a system passes through from conception to retirement. According to Holt, a life cycle consists of a series of stages that describe how a system's evolution changes over time, and each stage provides a checkpoint for crucial decisions, such as whether to advance, rework, or retire a system (Holt 2023). The typical life cycle begins with the conception stage, which involves defining stakeholder needs and establishing the foundation for what you want the system to achieve for its purpose. The development stage focuses on designing solutions and validating them against those needs which may lead to a prototype for the next stage which is production. Production continues, during which the actual system is built and constantly tested to ensure it meets the original design purpose and specifications. Once the system is in place, it moves into utilization, where it operates in its intended environment. This often goes hand in hand with the support stage, where maintenance, updates, and user assistance are provided. Finally, the system reaches retirement, where it is decommissioned, disposed of responsibly, or replaced. These stages do not always unfold in the same sequence. How they are executed depends on the life cycle model selected, and each model has its strengths and limitations. </p>
            <h3>Life Cycle Models</h3>
            <p>The first life cycle model talked about was the linear model, sometimes called the Waterfall Model as a classic version, representing a simple step-by-step approach. In this model, one phase is completed fully before the next begins. It is a straightforward method that is best suited to projects with clearly defined requirements from the start. Because of its sequential nature, the linear model allows for strong documentation, milestone tracking, and easy oversight. However, it is not very flexible as any late changes in the process can cause issues and is not good for any projects seeking to go long term hence the name linear was given to it. </p>
            <p>In contrast, the iterative model breaks development into repeated cycles. Instead of completing the entire system in one pass, the team creates a working version, gathers feedback, and refines the system in subsequent iterations. Each loop builds upon the last, allowing for continuous learning and adaptation. This model shines in environments where requirements may evolve or where early feedback is essential to success. According to the Institute of Data, this method supports a strong “emphasis on flexibility, incremental development, and continuous improvement makes it a valuable approach for projects with evolving requirements and a need for collaboration.” (Institute of Data). That said, it does require ongoing stakeholder engagement and careful scope management to prevent the project from getting stuck constantly refining the details. </p>
            <p>Finally, the incremental model also divides the system into parts, but rather than looping back through entire development cycles, each increment adds a new piece of functionality. These pieces are planned and delivered in multiple phases that allows the system to gradually grow. With each increment, teams can test, receive feedback, and adapt future increments accordingly. However, some challenges can be earlier increments locking in structural decisions, architectural missteps in early development can be difficult to correct which makes premature decision making incredibly important. </p>
            <h3>Why Thinking in Life Cycles is Important</h3>
            <p>Life cycle thinking is important because it allows engineers to look beyond the present and to consider how systems will behave, interact, and transform over time. The first benefit of this perspective is the ability to design for change. A constricted, one-time approach may work in static environments, but digital systems rarely stay under fixed conditions. Whether it is adapting to new standards, integrating new components, or changing based on user feedback, design changes become more natural because of life cycle thinking. Modeling a system’s life cycle enables stakeholders to predict and plan for how systems will adapt, ensuring resilience and long-term functionality. </p>
            <p>Sustainability is another but it is a key point as well. Thinking in life cycles encourages the design of systems that are not only effective but also socially and environmentally responsible. This is apparent in an article I read where they talked about, “Commitment to sustainable manufacturing solutions enhances cost-effectiveness and supports a circular economy.” (Motion drives and controls). For digital systems, this can translate to energy-efficient design, responsible data handling, accessible user interfaces, and responsible decommissioning practices. These are extremely important to know and plan out because they can lead to digital waste, security vulnerabilities, or the loss of valuable institutional knowledge. </p>
            <p>Clear stakeholder communication also largely benefits from proper thinking of life cycles. MBSE frameworks rely on consistent modeling languages and ontologies to unify understanding. Stakeholders interact with visual, structured models that outline every stage of the system. This reduces ambiguity and helps everyone be one with expectations, making collaboration more productive overall.  </p>
            <p>Lastly, life cycle models help reduce risk. Anticipating system evolution, incorporating early validation, and being able to adapt constantly all contribute to catching potential problems before they become costly or dangerous. The iterative and incremental models are particularly helpful here, as they allow for constant testing and learning. </p>
            <h3>How MBSE Relates to Thinking in Life Cycles</h3>
            <p>Model-Based Systems Engineering enhances life cycle thinking by replacing static documents with dynamic, interconnected models. These models are more than just diagrams, they are living blueprints that evolve alongside the system. With MBSE, every requirement, component, interface, and behavior are represented in a way that supports consistency, traceability, and automation. Rather than capturing design decisions in isolated reports, MBSE integrates them into a cohesive framework. Engineers can visualize system behavior, define how components interact, and verify requirements all within a single environment. By embedding views such as structural breakdowns, interface definitions, and connectivity models into the life cycle, MBSE ensures that teams work with accurate, current, and actionable insights at every stage. </p>
            <p>This modeling approach also supports reuse. Well-constructed MBSE models can become libraries of components and configurations that future projects can adapt and build upon. This not only speeds up development but also promotes higher quality by drawing from proven designs. By making systems more transparent, flexible, and integrated, MBSE turns the life cycle from a theoretical framework into a practical, operational tool. </p>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>All in all, thinking about life cycles is not just project timelines they are the story of how systems come to life, evolve, and retire. In systems engineering, understanding this story is critical. Whether you are creating software, infrastructure, or embedded systems, the life cycle model you choose will shape not only how your system is built, but how well it endures. With linear being straightforward but no flexibility, iterative focuses on feedback and constantly changing, and incremental balances constant updates for adaptability. Choosing wisely and properly with many more factors is important for the future vision of your system. </p>

            <header class="article-header">
               <h2>Module 1.2 Blog Post</h2>
            </header>
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>In the world of technology where digital environments, systems, and products are being constantly created every day, you do not think about the philosophies behind the designs and everything, but they are made specifically for people in mind. Huma-centered design (HCD) is the act of designing digital systems based on how people think, interact, and feel about technology. This blog will address a variety of topics related to HCD from understanding the points of people are focused on the design of systems to the key UX laws because all these points are extremely important designing around human interaction in mind today as technology continues to constantly grow from new to upgraded designs. </p>
            <h3>Human-Centered Design</h3>
            <p>First, we need to understand why we create systems for people which is because humans process information differently than what you would obviously expect from a machine especially because people have selected perception, imperfect memory, and poor vision in general. We can classify this as limitations, but that is not a negative notation because it is optimization. This does not mean however that optimization is perfect for digital interfaces. This is why we need extra care for how our systems appear and a wonderful way to go about this is structures. Before we continue, we need to talk about the perspectives of ISO and IDEO’s Field Guide. ISO is about the users throughout the whole design and development process whereas, IDEO is a more flexible approach which focuses on empathy of the users by learning constantly about the emotions, behaviors, and needs. These two are good on their own, but I believe they could truly shine together as ISO would provide a powerful base in structure, while IDEO would lead in new directions with empathy from users.  </p>
            <p>In Designing with the Mind in Mind by Jeff Johnson, it is mentioned that “Perceiving structure in our environment helps us make sense of objects and events quickly... when people are navigating through software or websites, they do not scrutinize screens carefully and read every word. They scan quickly for information relevant to their goals.” (Johnson, 2020). This makes complete sense as you yourself must have experienced doing this recently and informs us when we see clustered systems we become overwhelmed we cannot focus on something specifically thus making us unable to act occasionally. This is called visual hierarchy and understanding this hierarchy is important because good designers understand this way of perception people have by showing empathy in their designs as well as other factors such as the users' goals or situational context depending on if they are in a hurry or not. Attention goes quite alongside this as well because of the fact our attention is limited and selective so leading users along is an important part of design as well. An example would be the distinct colors and shades that are utilized in design to help guide users to understand the interface and allow the user to not overlook crucial functions. </p>
            <h3>Jakob's Law</h3>
            <p>Now let us talk about the Laws of UX starting with Jakob’s Law. This law is about the expectations users started having about systems being either the same or similar. This expectation is what can lead to user frustration so being able to create a sense of familiarity with the systems is extremely important. This does not necessarily want the websites to look aesthetically the same, the only ask is consistency in how certain things are done like symbols such as the magnifying glass for a search option or when you are shopping online the shopping cart and the location of these symbols being in similar locations help users. This does not mean that everything is the same as mentioned in Laws of UX textbook they conclude, “Jakob’s law is not advocating for sameness in the sense that every product and experience should be identical. Instead, it is a guiding principle that reminds designers that people leverage previous experience to help them in understanding new experiences.” (Yablonski, 2024). Keeping this in mind when designing a digital interface is meant to allow the users to be productive through familiar systems and patterns instead of learning completely new ones while being a unique interface in other ways. </p>
            <h3>Fitt's Law</h3>
            <p>While Jakob’s Law was about familiarity, the next law Fitt’s Law is about making interactions easier for users. Fitt’s Law is the relationship between the time it takes to interact with an object from the distance away from the input method and the size of the object. (Yablonski, 2024). The reason this law is important is because it references our attention in how if certain objects are too small or in an obscure location, we immediately disregard the object even if it is a useful one at that, but the opposite holds true in the fact that an object too big or in an inconvenient location for other objects this causes issues and frustrations with the interface. The other issue is properly spacing out objects to fit a certain size on the interface, especially if it is on a smaller screen like mobile devices and the selector being your fingers. This is quite a simple law to understand, but extremely hard to perfect as there are many factors that need to be considered. </p>
            <h3>Miller's Law</h3>
            <p>Miller’s Law is stated that “The average person can hold only about seven items in their short-term memory, suggesting that concise communication is key for clarity and retention.” (Helio 2023). This simply broken down is that when users are required to remember long sequences or information without assistance, they are more likely to not commit to the task to make a mistake along the way. A solution to this is to provide smaller chunks of information and assistance with reminders of past information. This helps us understand to respect and understand the human brain and how it processes information and help support users with proper ways to communicate through the interface. </p>
            <h3>Hick's Law</h3>
            <p>Finally, the last law, Hick’s Law, is about making decisions simpler because of how the brain works when there are more choices available, the longer it takes. The benefits of this law and to always incorporate it into your system interfaces is “this principle in design optimizes decision-making, reduces cognitive load, and engages users effectively.” (Alpha.One 2024). This optimizes the experience for users and provides options for them to optimize the amount of information they can see. An example to use this law is a filter system in a site like Amazon where you have the search bar for a specific item and then within the page a filter that can go over the prices or brands you can see. </p>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Design is all about the users and that will not change in time. In fact, this will continue to grow and evolve with more details and solutions to guide users by learning continuous learning of user's interactions. The strongest example of this is empathy for the users compared to perception and attention even though both are also indispensable. The understanding of cognitive loads and the wide number of emotions that can be felt when using their systems is critical in the design process and is also why I valued a balance in the ISO and IDEO perspectives. Overall, the design process is complex because of the range from easy details such as familiarity of symbols or layout to something about the size of fonts or symbols and the distance from other objects.  </p>
