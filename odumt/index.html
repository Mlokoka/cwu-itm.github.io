            <h3>Model-Based Systems Engineering<h3>
            <p>Model-Based Systems engineering also known as (MSBE) is a formalized application of modeling with the purpose of supporting system requirements, analysis, design, verification and validation activities starting in the conceptual design phase and continuing through development and later life cycle phases. 
Model is a simplified version of a concept, it can be a mathematical, graphical, or physical representation. In this case the objectives of model in Model-Based Systems Engineering is to facilitate understanding, aid in making of decisions, and to explain, control or predict events. Model-Based Engineering is exceedingly important for multiple reasons. Unprecedented levels of systems understanding can be accomplished through integrated analytics. This ties to a model-centric technical baseline. Model-based systems engineering provides mechanisms for driving more engineering depth without increasing the cost. By not imploding the cost this leads to affordability and affordability allows defects to be detected earlier. It is important to model because this drives a consistent specification. Modelling also plays a significant role in analysing and interrogating the system design as well as automating. 
The best way to have a successful model-based approach is scoping the problem. It is important to ask questions such as what does one want to get out of their models? Scoping and managing a modelling effort is an art and a science. The marketplace for MBSE tools has been expanding beyond graphical modeling and requirement tools with a focus on model integration and data. 
By integrating modeling and analysis support for decision makers not only will decision makers have more options and information to draw conclusions. Additionally, the integrated analytics models will increase the amount of information available to decision makers and help them to come to conclusions.By exploring tools, one can visualize and understand a complex tradespace that is rooted in model-based system engineering. This can provide early insight into the impact of decisions including but not limited to technical solutions as well as complex public policies.
The main focus of most current industry efforts is to move closer to a model-based engineering approach focused on integrating data via models. Engineering is the root to understanding all items that could impact a design and determine a resolution for the items. This is also known as an integrated end-to-end modeling environment that supports this. By bringing together different but also related models into a data rich, architecture centric environment, new levels of systems understanding is able to be achieved. Model-based systems engineering forms a way to achieve integration.(INCOSE, n.d.) 
Systems Engineering Demystified goes into detail of the history of systems engineering. Systems engineering has essentially  been around since the beginning of time and has been employed since mankind started building and developing complex systems. Humans have observed complex systems like the solar system ever since the ancient Greeks had first observed the motions of different planets and created models of the geocentric universe. Various examples of systems engineering could also be observed in the second world war. (Holt, 2021) 
Systems can be classified as many different things because there are many different types of systems. Natural systems which are representations of open systems that are characterized beyond the control of humans. These types of systems include but are not limited to weather systems, nature systems, environmental systems, and time systems. 
Another type of system is Designed Physical Systems, and this represents what the majority of people would immediately think when they’re considering a system. Such as tablets, computers, or cameras. The list is almost never ending. The systems will usually be made up of physical artifacts that represent the real world representation of the system. 
There are also Designed Abstract Systems that represent systems that have no physical artifacts but are used by people with the purpose of understanding or even explaining an idea or a concept. Some examples of systems like this would be equations, models, and so on. 
Human Activity Systems are people-based systems that can be observed within the real world. Systems like these are usually made to consist of different sets of people interacting to achieve a common goal and purpose. Examples of Human Activity Systems include but are not limited to social groups, political systems and people-based services.
And Transcendental Systems are systems that surpass humans current understanding. Examples of transcendental systems are unknown problems, numberwang, and deities.
The five different broad types of systems have a common set of characteristics that could be associated with all types of systems. The characteristics allow the various systems to be understood and developed. Every system has its own natural structure and can be considered as a set of interacting system elements. (Holt, 2021)
One of the many key aspects of a system that's essential to understand as a piece of a system are stakeholders that are associated with the system. Understanding stakeholders is exceedingly important to successful systems engineering. Stakeholders are defined as the role of any person, organization, or thing that has an interest in the system. Stakeholders aren’t actually just people but can actually be plenty of other things. Things like organizations, or quite literally anything can be a stakeholder. Stakeholders are outside the boundary of a system and enabling systems. The definition of a stakeholder is anything that has an interest in the system. It should also be noted that an enabling system is essentially a special type of stakeholder. Furthermore, is it exceedingly important to identify stakeholders because different stakeholders will look at the same system in different ways. This widely depends on the role of the stakeholder. Which in turn leads to the importance of context. (Holt, 2021)
Every single system has at least one boundary that is associated with the system. This helps to explain the scope of the system.There are various types of boundaries that include but are not limited to physical boundaries. Physical boundaries are a sort of enclosure that surrounds the system which separates it from the outside world. This would be like  the body of a car. There are also conceptual boundaries, these are boundaries with a non-physical boundary that could be imagined but not actually observed. This could be something like the transmitter and receiver on a satellite. Stakeholder boundaries are different stakeholders which can look at the same system in various ways, which therefore can perceive the boundary of a system which may change depending on the stakeholder. It is exceedingly important to understand which system elements are considered to be inside the boundary of a system and which are considered to be on the external boundary of a system. System elements are considered within the boundary of a system that will help to define exactly which type of system it is. Understanding what's inside the boundary is essential, especially in regard to system elements. Its necessary to to understand what lies outside of the boundary of the system. These would be things that exist outside of the boundary of the systems that are considered as either stakeholders or even enabling systems.Each time an interaction happens across the boundary of a system, it identifies the interface of that system.WHen interfaces are identified as an important part of systems engineering. This means that a boundary could be used to determine all interfaces between a system and the outside world. (Holt, 2021)
Module-based systems engineering is different from traditional engineering methods which rely on text based documents and manual processes. Model-based systems engineering uses digital modeling and simulation to design different systems. The models provide a visual and interactive way to represent system components and the connections between them. This is exceedingly helpful for complex interfaces and systems. It should also be noted that it is easier to update digital models. Because this makes model-based systems engineering more efficient than traditional methods and it adds clarity as well as reduces the risk of error and improves communication 
There are various benefits to Model-based systems engineering. One of the benefits is enhanced communication and collaboration. This is the visual and interactive nature of models that helps different stakeholders understand and contribute to the development process even better. Model-based systems engineering also improves quality and accuracy. This reduces the risk of errors and inconsistencies that are common in systems which are document-centric. This allows greater traceability. Models are necessary for providing a single source of truth which ensures that every single stakeholder is working with the same information that can identify system-level issues efficiently. Model-based systems can also be more complex, but in a good way. They are helpful when it comes to working with a system of systems, or any project that puts the resources of several systems that create a more complex one. This is because MBSE allows clear, intricate relationships, representations, and dependencies within a system. Scalability and flexibility is another benefit of model-based systems engineering. This is because MSE can be adapted to projects that are made of various complexities and sizes. This makes it a versatile approach that is suitable for a wide range of applications. This can also help to support product development through the whole lifecycle of the product.
The main components of MBSE is the systems architecture model also known as SAM. Another component of Model-based systems engineering is the engineering simulation software that determines whether what's inside of the systems architecture model will match the requirements and whether or not it will operate as planned. And a centralized computation that can be cloud-based or physical, which performs every function and stores results. Altogether, these parts make up the digital thread, this ensures that when various updates are made to a model, they’re also updated across every other model in the system. (McGrath & Jonker, 2023)
