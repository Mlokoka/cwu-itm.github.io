      <h3>Introduction to Model-Based Systems Engineering</h3>
      <p>Model-Based Systems engineering, also known as MBSE, is a formalized application of modeling with the purpose of supporting system requirements, analysis, design, verification, and validation activities starting in the conceptual design phase and continuing through development and later life cycle phases Model-Based Systems engineering also known as (MSBE) is a formalized application of modeling with the purpose of supporting system requirements, analysis, design, verification and validation activities starting in the conceptual design phase and continuing through development and later life cycle phases. 
Model is a simplified version of a concept, it can be a mathematical, graphical, or physical representation. In this case the objectives of model in Model-Based Systems Engineering is to facilitate understanding, aid in making of decisions, and to explain, control or predict events. Model-Based Engineering is exceedingly important for multiple reasons. Unprecedented levels of systems understanding can be accomplished through integrated analytics. This ties to a model-centric technical baseline. Model-based systems engineering provides mechanisms for driving more engineering depth without increasing the cost. By not imploding the cost this leads to affordability and affordability allows defects to be detected earlier. It is important to model because this drives a consistent specification. Modelling also plays a significant role in analysing and interrogating the system design as well as automating. 
The best way to have a successful model-based approach is scoping the problem. It is important to ask questions such as what does one want to get out of their models? Scoping and managing a modelling effort is an art and a science. The marketplace for MBSE tools has been expanding beyond graphical modeling and requirement tools with a focus on model integration and data.</p>
<p>By integrating modeling and analysis support for decision makers not only will decision makers have more options and information to draw conclusions. Additionally, the integrated analytics models will increase the amount of information available to decision makers and help them to come to conclusions.By exploring tools, one can visualize and understand a complex tradespace that is rooted in model-based system engineering. This can provide early insight into the impact of decisions including but not limited to technical solutions as well as complex public policies.</p>
<p>The main focus of most current industry efforts is to move closer to a model-based engineering approach focused on integrating data via models. Engineering is the root to understanding all items that could impact a design and determine a resolution for the items. This is also known as an integrated end-to-end modeling environment that supports this. By bringing together different but also related models into a data rich, architecture centric environment, new levels of systems understanding is able to be achieved. Model-based systems engineering forms a way to achieve integration.(INCOSE, n.d.) </p>
<h3>Why Are Systems So Important?</h3>
      <p>Systems Engineering Demystified goes into detail of the history of systems engineering. Systems engineering has essentially  been around since the beginning of time and has been employed since mankind started building and developing complex systems. Humans have observed complex systems like the solar system ever since the ancient Greeks had first observed the motions of different planets and created models of the geocentric universe. Various examples of systems engineering could also be observed in the second world war. (Holt, 2021) </p>
<p>Systems can be classified as many different things because there are many different types of systems. Natural systems which are representations of open systems that are characterized beyond the control of humans. These types of systems include but are not limited to weather systems, nature systems, environmental systems, and time systems.</p>
<p>Another type of system is Designed Physical Systems, and this represents what the majority of people would immediately think when they’re considering a system. Such as tablets, computers, or cameras. The list is almost never ending. The systems will usually be made up of physical artifacts that represent the real world representation of the system.</p>
<p>There are also Designed Abstract Systems that represent systems that have no physical artifacts but are used by people with the purpose of understanding or even explaining an idea or a concept. Some examples of systems like this would be equations, models, and so on. 
Human Activity Systems are people-based systems that can be observed within the real world. Systems like these are usually made to consist of different sets of people interacting to achieve a common goal and purpose. Examples of Human Activity Systems include but are not limited to social groups, political systems and people-based services.</p>
And Transcendental Systems are systems that surpass humans current understanding. Examples of transcendental systems are unknown problems, numberwang, and deities.
The five different broad types of systems have a common set of characteristics that could be associated with all types of systems. The characteristics allow the various systems to be understood and developed. Every system has its own natural structure and can be considered as a set of interacting system elements. (Holt, 2021)
One of the many key aspects of a system that's essential to understand as a piece of a system are stakeholders that are associated with the system. Understanding stakeholders is exceedingly important to successful systems engineering. Stakeholders are defined as the role of any person, organization, or thing that has an interest in the system. Stakeholders aren’t actually just people but can actually be plenty of other things. Things like organizations, or quite literally anything can be a stakeholder. Stakeholders are outside the boundary of a system and enabling systems. The definition of a stakeholder is anything that has an interest in the system. It should also be noted that an enabling system is essentially a special type of stakeholder. Furthermore, is it exceedingly important to identify stakeholders because different stakeholders will look at the same system in different ways. This widely depends on the role of the stakeholder. Which in turn leads to the importance of context. (Holt, 2021)
Every single system has at least one boundary that is associated with the system. This helps to explain the scope of the system.There are various types of boundaries that include but are not limited to physical boundaries. Physical boundaries are a sort of enclosure that surrounds the system which separates it from the outside world. This would be like  the body of a car. There are also conceptual boundaries, these are boundaries with a non-physical boundary that could be imagined but not actually observed. This could be something like the transmitter and receiver on a satellite. Stakeholder boundaries are different stakeholders which can look at the same system in various ways, which therefore can perceive the boundary of a system which may change depending on the stakeholder. It is exceedingly important to understand which system elements are considered to be inside the boundary of a system and which are considered to be on the external boundary of a system. System elements are considered within the boundary of a system that will help to define exactly which type of system it is. Understanding what's inside the boundary is essential, especially in regard to system elements. Its necessary to to understand what lies outside of the boundary of the system. These would be things that exist outside of the boundary of the systems that are considered as either stakeholders or even enabling systems.Each time an interaction happens across the boundary of a system, it identifies the interface of that system.WHen interfaces are identified as an important part of systems engineering. This means that a boundary could be used to determine all interfaces between a system and the outside world. (Holt, 2021)
Module-based systems engineering is different from traditional engineering methods which rely on text based documents and manual processes. Model-based systems engineering uses digital modeling and simulation to design different systems. The models provide a visual and interactive way to represent system components and the connections between them. This is exceedingly helpful for complex interfaces and systems. It should also be noted that it is easier to update digital models. Because this makes model-based systems engineering more efficient than traditional methods and it adds clarity as well as reduces the risk of error and improves communication 
</p>
      <h3>Closing Statements in Regard to MSBE</h3>
      <p>There are various benefits to Model-based systems engineering. One of the benefits is enhanced communication and collaboration. This is the visual and interactive nature of models that helps different stakeholders understand and contribute to the development process even better. Model-based systems engineering also improves quality and accuracy. This reduces the risk of errors and inconsistencies that are common in systems which are document-centric. This allows greater traceability. Models are necessary for providing a single source of truth which ensures that every single stakeholder is working with the same information that can identify system-level issues efficiently. Model-based systems can also be more complex, but in a good way. They are helpful when it comes to working with a system of systems, or any project that puts the resources of several systems that create a more complex one. This is because MBSE allows clear, intricate relationships, representations, and dependencies within a system. Scalability and flexibility is another benefit of model-based systems engineering. This is because MSE can be adapted to projects that are made of various complexities and sizes. This makes it a versatile approach that is suitable for a wide range of applications. This can also help to support product development through the whole lifecycle of the product.
The main components of MBSE is the systems architecture model also known as SAM. Another component of Model-based systems engineering is the engineering simulation software that determines whether what's inside of the systems architecture model will match the requirements and whether or not it will operate as planned. And a centralized computation that can be cloud-based or physical, which performs every function and stores results. Altogether, these parts make up the digital thread, this ensures that when various updates are made to a model, they’re also updated across every other model in the system. (McGrath & Jonker, 2023)
</p>
      <h3>Model Based Systems Engineering & User Experience</h3>
      <p>Now that the reader is already familiar with Model-based Systems Engineering which is the practice of developing a set of related models which help, design,simulate, and document a system that's under development, it is important to be aware of how Model-Based Systems Engineering ties into user experience. The application of modeling systems in a cost-effective way in order to explore and document system characteristics is a colossal part of MBSE. When testing and validating the characteristics of a system early, models can facilitate timely learning of both behaviors and properties. This in turn enables fast feedback on design and requirements decisions. This plays a role into how the user of the developed model ends up experiencing the model. Models provide an effective way to update, explore, and communicate aspects of a system to stakeholders while simultaneously reducing and eliminating dependence on traditional documents significantly. It should be noted that historically Model-Based Systems Engineering has been laser focused on recording and expressing design, analysis, requirements and verification information. As modeling technology continues to mature, it has provided people with increased value by providing users with accelerated learning. This can provide better insights into the physical world (Skaled Agile, Inc., n.d.). This is necessary for evolving live systems and enabling enterprise solution delivery. Enterprise solution delivery is defined as a large solution integration and delivery which describes practices that are required to apply safe principles and practices to the operation, development, specification, and evolution of the worlds biggest and most sophisticated software applications, networks, and cyber-physical systems. (Skaled Agile, Inc., n.d.) Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) and User Experience (UX) design, while the two are traditionally known and viewed as separate disciplines, are increasingly interconnected in the development of complex systems, specifically as the main focus on human-centered design becomes more important to systems thinking. Model-Based Systems Engineering is a formalized methodology that uses models to support the requirements such as, analysis, design, verification, and validation activities throughout the development lifecycle of a system. This shifts the main emphasis from document-based engineering to a model-centric approach. This allows for improved integration, visualization,  and the traceability of complex system components and their interactions. When User Experience design is brought into the fold of Model-Based Systems Engineering, the user can become a central component of the system model. As opposed to being just an afterthought that is addressed during the interface design phase. This integration will ensure that the system’s functionality aligns closely with needs, human behaviors, and limitations from the very start of the design process.	
</p>
<h3>Psychology’s Influence in User Experience</h3>
<p>The influence of psychology in UX, which was spearheaded by influential figures such as Donald Norman and Jane Fulton Suri, plays a crucial role in the integration process. Norman’s foundational perspective on user experience emphasizes the importance of a system being useful, intuitive, and delightful for its users. When applying this within an MBSE framework, this principle leads to systems that are not only technically large but also practically usable. For example, early modeling within Model-Based Systems Engineering is able to incorporate user task flows, cognitive load considerations, and emotional responses, this ensures that the human-machine interface is not only operable but most importantly. optimal. User Experience inputs can guide the architecture of a system by defining human-centric requirements that are able to be traced throughout the system model, this can influence everything from interface design to safety protocols. This approach is especially vital in high-stakes domains like aerospace, defense, and healthcare, this is where human error resulting from poor UX design can have catastrophic consequences.	
Jane Fulton Suri’s human-centered design methodology—anchored in empathy, observation, and cross-functional collaboration—also complements MBSE by encouraging engineers to go beyond technical specifications. Her approach advocates for deeply understanding users in their natural environments, an insight that can be embedded into system models to reflect real-world contexts. Additionally, ethnographic research findings can shape model parameters and behavioral simulations, this ensures that user scenarios and edge cases are considered early in the design. Furthermore, this reduces the need for costly redesigns late in development and improves overall system performance and adoption.
By incorporating User Experience into Model-Based Systems Engineering, this also promotes a more agile development process. As models evolve, models can be continuously validated against User Experience criteria, which allows for rapid feedback and refinement. This dynamic of feedback-driven development cycle is essential for building systems that truly serve users' wants and needs in ever-changing operational environments. With that being said MBSE and UX design are not competing paradigms but rather complementary approaches that, when combined, offer a more holistic and user-aligned system development process. As systems continue to grow in complexity. The interface between human and machine becomes more critical, the collaboration between MBSE and UX which is rooted in the principles of psychology, design thinking, and engineering will define the next generation of systems that are not only efficient but deeply human-centric (Yablonski, 2024).

      <h3>Systems Development Life Cycle Insights</h3>
      <p>​The Systems Development Life Cycle also known as SDLC is a structured approach that's used in software engineering to design, test, develop, and maintain software systems. This planned approach provides a systematic process for building software that ensures quality and accuracy. The Systems Design Life Cycle goes through several phases which include feasibility analysis, planning, development, design, testing, deployment, and maintenance. Every single phase phase has specific deliverables and is meant to ensure that the software meets the desired requirements and functions properly (Wikipedia,2024)
A few commonly used Systems Development Life Cycle models are iterative, linear, and incremental. This offers different methodologies that’re suited for various project needs depending on the situation. The linear model, which is also known as the Waterfall model, follows a strict and precise sequence of phases where each must be completed before the next part of the process can commence. Due to its simplicity and structured nature it is easier to manage,control, and document than other processes. This model is most effective when project requirements are stable and well thought out from the beginning (Wikipedia, 2024). However, a significant drawback is the lack of flexibility once development starts, accommodating changes becomes difficult. Nonetheless, testing occurs deep into the process, this often leads to late-stage discovery of defects. This in turn increases the cost and complexity of fixing issues (Wikipedia, 2024).
With that being said, the iterative model involves developing the system through repeated cycles also known as iterations. This allows for refinement with each cycle. Every single iteration passes through phases such as design, development, planning, and testing. This leads to the promotion of early problem detection and incremental improvement (Ellow.io, 2023). The iteration model supports adaptability and is exceedingly useful when requirements are not fully known. This promotes constant feedback and improvement. Although, the iterative model is able to result in increased project complexity due to overlapping cycles and risks scope creep if these challengers are not properly managed (Ellow.io, 2023).
The incremental model breaks the project into miniature modules or components that are tested, developed, and delivered in different increments. Every single increment builds off one another which results in added functionality to the system that can be delivered independently. This will allow users to access part of the system early (Guru99, 2023). This early delivery of features is beneficial for user feedback and early revenue generation. Although it should be noted that it requires precise planning and integration to confirm that the future modules align with previously delivered components. Additionally, initial architecture must be well rounded to accommodate for ongoing possible future integration (Guru99, 2023).
Thinking in terms of a system’s life cycle is essential for effective system design, as well as sustainability and long-term evolution. The Systems Design Life Cycle offers a well defined plan that grants structure and clarity. Which results in the support of consistent project execution and goal alignment (Guru99, 2023). Looking from a sustainability perspective, practices such as thorough documentation, regular testing, and scheduled maintenance enable the system to be updated and remain functional over time. It's important that digital systems must evolve to meet new user needs and technological advances, an SDLC helps integrate change systematically, ensuring stability during transitions (Ellow.io, 2023).
Nonetheless, using iterative and incremental models supports constant development and refinement, this allows for systems to evolve in response to real-world feedback and changing requirements. In a world that has rapidly changing technological environments, this adaptability is completely necessary.. Without an SDLC approach, teams may struggle with confusing objectives, limited scalability, misaligned timelines, and poor quality control, (Wikipedia, 2024).

      <h3>SLDC Summarized</h3>
      <p>The Systems Device Life Cycle is a fundamental framework within software development that guides the planning, maintenance, creation, and future retirement of different digital systems. Systems Device Life Cycle provides structured stages that help development teams manage complexity, reduce risk possibility, and enhance project planning. By thoroughly selecting the proper life cycle model. Whether its iterative, linear, or incremental teams are able to align development strategies with the specific challenges and needs of each project. Every single model offers distinct advantages. Linear approaches bring clarity and structure. Iterative models encourage continuous improvement. And incremental methods allow for quicker delivery of functional components. Lifecycle thinking ensures that systems are not only built efficiently but are also designed with long-term sustainability in mind. This perspective becomes increasingly important as technologies improve, evolve and user demands grow more complex and sophisticated. By incorporating lifecycle principles this promotes adaptability, system resilience, and user relevance. Additionally, it encourages proactive system scalability and smoother integration of emerging technologies. In an age of rapid digital transformation, adopting a comprehensive life cycle-oriented approach enables organizations to stay competitive and deliver lasting value through their digital solutions. Systems Device Life Cycle supports both immediate project success and the enduring effectiveness of the systems it helps and hopes to shape.To summarize in a comprehensive manner, the Systems Device Life Cycle serves as a foundational framework within software development. When one takes the time to carefully select among iterative, linear, and incremental models based on the nature of the project and the task that they may face, development teams can manage complexity, reduce risk, improve planning, and support the long-term success and sustainability of digital systems. As technologies and user needs continue to grow, the importance of lifecycle thinking in system design becomes even more apparent, ensuring that digital solutions remain effective, relevant, and resilient over time.

<h3>Introducing the Concept of Human-Centered Design</h3>
<p> When User Experience designers take the time to understand the scientific study of the mind and behavior better known as psychology, it allows for the user to have a better experience. We human beings have an unconscious blueprint based on how we perceive, process, and understand the world that surrounds us. The knowledge gained through studying psychology grants people with the ability to decipher the blueprint. Designers can now use this newfound knowledge to create more clairvoyant, human-centered designs, products and experiences. Key principles from psychology can be used as building blocks to guide the process of designing in a way that has been properly adapted to people. These building blocks are the fundamental basis for human-centered design.</p>
<h3>The Importance of Human-Centered Design</h3>
<p>
Human-Centered Design is especially important because it has a major focus on the process of creating systems, products, and services that are deeply aligned with the behaviors of actual individuals. Taking a user-first approach leads to solutions that are more meaningful. . When users have the ability to intuitively navigate a product or service, they’re more likely to engage with it and find it to be of use. This ultimately leads to more successful outcomes.
</p>
<p>
Another reason Human-Centered Design is so meaningful is the fact that it increases the likelihood of sustained engagement. According to IDEO.org, “products that incorporate human-centered design principles enjoy greater acceptance and engagement among users” (<a href="#ideo2015">IDEO.org, 2015</a>). By taking the time to address real-world challenges and preferences, Human-Centered Design creates experiences that resonate deeply with users and fit properly into their lives. Nonetheless, incorporating user feedback early into the design process helps diminish development risks and reduce long-term costs. Jakob Nielsen emphasizes that “the earlier in the design process a problem is found and fixed, the less expensive the fix” (<a href="#nielsen1993">Nielsen, 1993</a>). This approach is more proactive and saves time and ensures that products are viable and user-approved before launch.
</p><h3>Comparing ISO 9241-210 and IDEO’s Field Guide to Human-Centered Design</h3>
<p>
In the case of examining Human-Centered Design, both ISO 9241-210 and IDEO’s <em>Field Guide to Human-Centered Design</em> offer exceedingly valuable frameworks, although their perspectives differentiate in structure, application, and philosophical emphasis. ISO 9241-210, titled <em>Ergonomics of human-system interaction – Part 210: Human-centred design for interactive systems</em>, is a formal international standard that provides a structured and principle-based approach to Human-Centered Design, this is mainly aimed at professionals in systems design, engineering, and ergonomics (<a href="#iso2019">ISO, 2019</a>). In comparison to IDEO’s Field Guide, a more accessible and narrative-driven resource developed by a leading design firm, focusing on social impact, creativity, and practical implementation in a variety of contexts, especially within underserved or developing communities (<a href="#ideo2015">IDEO.org, 2015</a>).
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, ISO 9241-210 emphasizes several core principles of human-centered design: understanding and specifying the context of use, specifying user requirements, producing design solutions, and evaluating designs against user requirements, among others. These key principles are built on a systems engineering mindset and stress repeatability, traceability, and documentation. The standard is especially effective for organizations that rely on consistency across multiple  teams or that operate within regulated industries, such as healthcare or aerospace. Its strength lies in providing a universal language and criteria for usability and user-centered design within complex systems.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, IDEO’s Field Guide adopts a more flexible and empathetic approach. It is grounded within design thinking and it also encourages practitioners to dip themselves into the lives of users. IDEO’s Field Guide highlights different mindsets such as empathy, experimentation, and iteration rather than focusing on strict procedural adherence. The Field Guide is filled with case studies, toolkits, and exercises that make it highly practical for grassroots innovation and participatory design. It is particularly useful for NGOs, social enterprises, and educators who are looking to co-create solutions with communities rather than for them.
</p>
<p>
Moreover, after acknowledging the differences between both frameworks. One could still say with confidence that the two share a commitment to user involvement throughout the design process and have a strong emphasis on the value of continuous evaluation and feedback. ISO 9241-210 provides the formalization that makes Human-Centered Design scalable and measurable, whereas IDEO’s approach promotes inclusiveness and context sensitivity. When put together, the two offer complementary perspectives. On one hand, one offers a foundation of principles that are applicable across industries. While on the other hand, one offers actionable, human-centered methods that can adapt to fit cultural and social nuances over time. By integrating the structured clarity of ISO with the human empathy of IDEO, designers can create solutions that are both technically robust and socially impactful.
</p>
  <h3>Perception and Visual Hierarchy in User Experience and its Impact on Usability</h3>
  <p>
    Perception and visual hierarchy are foundational elements in user experience, often abbreviated to (UX). User Experience Design shapes how users interpret or even interact with digital interfaces. These principles are useful and important because they have an influence on the efficiency, clarity and satisfaction that users will experience when engaging with a product. When taking the time to draw on cognitive psychology and organize content in a visually meaningful way, User Experience designers are able to guide user attention and user behavior in a more effective manner (Lidwell, Holden, & Butler, 2010).
  </p>
  <p>
    Perception in UX is also very important because it refers to how different users process sensory information, especially visual cues that grant them the opportunity to make sense of content. Gestalt principles such as proximity in regard to objects that are close together, similarity in regard to items that appear similar and are seen as related, and continuity which refers to the eye following lines and curves that create a sense of flow and movement. These principles all working together play a major role in shaping perception (Ware, 2013). For example, in an e-commerce environment like Amazon, when “Add to Cart,” “Wishlist,” and “Buy Now” buttons are grouped together and styled in a similar fashion, users will perceive them as functionally related. Whereas if the “Buy Now” button is spaced apart and designed with a distinct color, it becomes visually prioritized, therefore users will view it as important and hypothetically be more drawn to it. By applying proximity and similarity, this helps to reduce the chances of the user feeling a cognitive overload which in turn enhances usability by visually organizing options in a way that aligns with different user expectations. In like manner, continuity aids user navigation. In a horizontal navigation menu, users may expect elements to follow a predictable flow. If another add-on such as a drop-down menu breaks this visual pattern or appears in an unexpected location, users may begin to feel disoriented, which in turn disrupts their task flow.
  </p>
  <p>
    Whereas visual hierarchy, on the other hand, is the process of arranging interface elements in a way that indicates their importance, typically through variations in contrast, size, color and alignment. A  landing page that's well-designed exemplifies visual hierarchy. Visual hierarchy is a bold, central headline such as “Start Your Free Trial Today” captures one's attention first. When followed by a smaller explanatory paragraph, and finally a high-contrast call-to-action button. This sequence directs users’ visual path, which ensures that they comprehend the offer before acting. Without this important addition to the structure, users might miss critical actions, negatively affecting possible conversions. </p><p>
    Form design also benefits heavily from visual hierarchy. Labels placed directly above form fields, the use of asterisks for required information, and prominent error messaging help reduce mistakes and guide user input. When forms lack these cues—such as using indistinguishable field styles or poorly contrasted error text—users are more likely to become frustrated, potentially abandoning the process (Nielsen Norman Group, 2020).
  </p>
  <p>
    At its core, effective User Experience design seamlessly integrates perception and visual hierarchy. Using a mobile banking app as an example, the use of consistent similarity. When grouping related services together, better known as proximity, and featuring the account balance prominently at the top, also known as hierarchy, all contributes to a smoother, and more intuitive experience. By understanding how users visually process information, designers have the opportunity to create interfaces that feel accessible, natural, and efficient.
  </p>
  <p>
Perception and visual hierarchy are very important tools for user experience designers. These tools help designers with the process of creating websites and apps that are easier for people to use and understand. When users take the time to visit a digital product, they need to quickly know where to look, what to click, when to click and how to complete tasks. Perception is how users take in and make sense of what they view on the screen in front of them. Visual hierarchy is a reference to the order of how designers arrange things like text, buttons, and images which shall allow the most important parts to stand out. By using these tools, digital products not only work better, but also feel better to use. One example of this, a large bold button tells the user it’s important. The process of grouping similar items close together helps users know they belong to the same category. These miniature choices make a huge difference in how people feel when using a specific product. This allows the user to feel more confident, less frustrated, and more likely to enjoy their experience. In simpler terms, proper user experience design is not only about how something looks. It’s also about how it works and how it makes individual users feel. When perception and visual hierarchy are used thoughtfully and properly, digital products become  more enjoyable, easier to use, and more likely to succeed.

  <h3>Designing for People, Putting UX Laws in Practice</h3>
  <p>
    The process of designing for people means putting the user at the center of every decision, not just in terms of how a product appears but how it functions and feels. Good user experience design revolves around helping people achieve their goals with confidence and minimal effort. This requires a strong understanding of how users perceive, focus on, and emotionally react to digital experiences. By using principles rooted in perception, attention, and empathy, designers can create products that feel intuitive, familiar, and enjoyable. Four foundational user experience laws Jakob’s Law, Fitts’s Law, Hick’s Law, and Miller’s Law all help to guide these human-centered design decisions (Yablonski, Laws of UX).
  </p>
  <p>
    Jakob’s Law states that users prefer for a site to work and function similarly to others that they’re already familiar with. This principle reminds us that familiarity reduces cognitive load while simultaneously increasing usability. When designers carefully take into consideration a users' mental models that are shaped by their past experiences on similar platforms, users can navigate and use the product with more ease. One example of this could be placing a search bar in the top right corner. If a company were to make the mistake of drastically changing a familiar format without a transition period, users would become disoriented and frustrated. This in turn would lead to a significant decline in user retention. Users would rather adapt and preserve a sense of control (Johnson, Designing with the Mind in Mind).
  </p>
  <p>
    Fitts’s Law places a major emphasis on the importance of ensuring that interactive elements are easy to access and engage with. By doing so, it explains that the time it takes for users to select an object is related to its size and distance. Large buttons placed close to where users expect them make interfaces faster and easier to use. Fitt’s Law is especially critical in touch environments, where small or closely spaced elements can create frustrating user experiences. In Laws of UX, Johnson discusses how touch targets that are too small or too close together increase the difficulty and time required for selection, particularly for users with limited dexterity (Designing with the Mind in Mind). Yablonski also emphasizes that appropriate sizing and spacing of interactive objects improves both efficiency and satisfaction for the user (Laws of UX).
  </p>
  <p>
    Hick’s Law explains that the more choices users are presented with, the longer it will take them to make a decision. Simplifying complexity is essential in designing usable interfaces. By organizing information clearly and presenting it progressively. For example, the early remotes had so many buttons they overwhelmed users, while newer smart remotes reduce visible options and simplify navigation. I remember when I was younger, about eight years old I would press all of the buttons on the long Comcast remote to see what would happen.Looking back it indeed was overwhelming to have so many options When users are presented with too many options at once, it increases their mental load and slows them down  </p>
  <p>
   Last but not least, Miller’s Law addresses the limits of human short-term memory. People can usually hold around 7 items in their memory at a time. Chunking information into smaller, grouped segments helps users better process and recall what they view. Johnson thoroughly explains how breaking information into digestible chunks improves comprehension, especially in tasks such as form completion or instructional steps (Designing with the Mind in Mind). Yablonski also emphasizes that grouping related items reduces mental strain and supports users in completing their tasks efficiently (Laws of UX).
  </p>
  <p>
    When all is said and done, designing for people means designing with empathy. It's not enough for a product to look appealing, it must also support real people in real situations. Understanding how users think, behave, and feel helps reduce confusion and create smoother experiences. The UX laws outlined in the works of Jeff Johnson and Jon Yablonski provide a valuable framework for making these thoughtful, people-first design decisions.
  </p>
  <h3>How Memory & Mental Models Influence User Interaction</h3>
  <p>
    Understanding and reducing cognitive demands is essential for creating intuitive designs that are user-friendly. It is important to minimize the mental effort required to interact with an interface. The cognitive load plays a pivotal role in usability. When cognitive demands are high, users are more susceptible to negative feelings such as confusion or frustration. To create seamless user experiences, designers must anticipate the mental limitations of their users and shape interfaces that feel natural and efficient.
  </p>
  <p>
    Johnson emphasizes that the human brain has strict limitations when it comes to processing and retaining information. For example, a person’s short-term memory can only hold a measly four items at a time, and humans are usually poor at multitasking. When a UX Designer becomes familiar with these cognitive constraints, designs that require users to hold information across multiple screens or interpret unfamiliar icons can quickly become overwhelming to the average person. The more an interface demands from a user's memory and attention, the more likely the user is to make mistakes or abandon the task completely.
  </p><p>
    One way to reduce cognitive load is through chunking, this is the process of organizing information into smaller units that are more manageable. This approach aligns with how our memory processes information and makes complex tasks easier to handle.One example would be breaking a long checkout process into step-by-step stages, which helps users focus on one decision at a time. Another effective method is using recognition over recall because it enhances usability. Designers should present visible options that are presented as visual cues that guide decision-making. Recognition is significantly less mentally taxing than recall, which places a greater burden on working memory.
  </p>
  <p>
    In Yablonksi’s book The Laws of UX, Yablonski thoroughly explains his support for these principles by advocating for the use of visual hierarchy. A clear hierarchy that directs users’ attention to what matters most. This not only simplifies navigation but also ensures users aren't overwhelmed by a flood of competing elements. For instance, making primary actions like “Submit” or “Next” stand out visually helps reduce uncertainty and cognitive strain. 
  </p>
   <p>
    Another powerful strategy that UX Designers need to utilize is maintaining consistency throughout the interface. When users encounter familiar layouts their brains can rely on established patterns which in turn require less cognitive effort to interpret what’s going on. Johnson and Yablonski both stress that predictable design reduces the mental energy needed to learn or adapt to a new interface. A consistent user experience not only builds trust but also speeds up task completion. Users can transfer knowledge from one part of the system to another.
  </p>
  <p>
    In essence, minimizing cognitive demands is about respecting the user’s limited attention and memory. Interfaces should be designed to support human thinking as opposed to challenging it. By chunking information, favoring recognition over recall, using effective visual hierarchy, and enforcing consistency, designers are able to create interfaces that are not only functional but also mentally effortless. The combined insights from Johnson's cognitive psychology foundation and Yablonski's practical design laws provide a clear roadmap for creating digital experiences that feel intuitive, reduce user fatigue, and improve satisfaction.
  </p><h3> How Interface Consistency and System Feedback Improve Usability</h3>
  <p>
    Interface consistency and system feedback are fundamental principles in user experience design that significantly enhance usability. It is imperative for one to note that fundamental concepts of UX Design can be analyzed in terms of the theoretical groundwork. The consistency is essential due to its direct impact on a user’s ability to interact with a system properly. Interface consistency refers to maintaining regularity in the design of elements across different parts of a user interface. This includes consistent placement, visual design, terminology, and behavior of interface elements. In the book Designing with the Mind in Mind, Jeff Johnson emphasizes the importance of consistency and links it to the human cognitive preference for patterns. He defines the notion that people rely heavily on past experiences and established mental models when interacting with new systems. Consistent interfaces reduce the cognitive load by allowing users to predict the behavior of elements based on previous interactions, which speeds up learning and reduces errors (Johnson, 2020). For example, if a "Save" button is always located in the same corner and styled the same way across different pages of an application, users do not have to search for it or relearn its function each time. Predictability is important because it improves the user's confidence and satisfaction with the system.
  </p>
  <p>
    Yablonski builds on this idea in Laws of UX, especially through the “Law of Consistency,” which illustrates that users are more likely to transfer their knowledge from one part of a system to another when similar actions and elements behave in similar ways. This not only enhances usability but also supports accessibility by making interfaces more inclusive to users with cognitive limitations or those who are new to technology (Yablonski, 2020). Moreover, consistency extends beyond a single product. It can involve aligning with platform conventions, which helps users apply their knowledge from one app to another. Cross-platform consistency further eases the learning curve and supports smoother user experiences. Although, consistency alone is not enough. System feedback is the information returned to users about what the system is doing or has already done. For the most part System Feedback is equally critical to usability. Johnson disputes that feedback satisfies a foundational human need for closure. When people interact with a system, they expect a reaction that confirms their actions have been received and are being processed. Without feedback, users may become uncertain, repeat actions unnecessarily, or believe that something is broken (Johnson, 2020). People want to feel as though their actions have been validated. For example, when a user submits a form, a confirmation message or animation indicating success reassures them that the submission was successful. On the other hand, if the form disappears or appears to be unchanged, the user may assume nothing happened which can lead to bewilderment. The interplay between interface consistency and system feedback is where usability truly flourishes. A consistent interface makes it easier for users to anticipate feedback. When users know what to expect and can see the system responding appropriately, their mental model aligns with the system model. Johnson underscores that mismatches between users' expectations and the system’s behavior often lead to usability problems. When Feedback is designed consistently, it reinforces the user’s mental model and creates a sense of control and reliability (Johnson, 2020).  Furthermore, consistent system feedback supports error recovery. In the unfortunate event of a failure such as a failed login attempt. A well-designed feedback mechanism such as a red message stating "Incorrect password, please try again" informs the user what went wrong and guides them toward the proper action. Yablonski notes that effective User Experience anticipates user mistakes and provides clear, constructive feedback to resolve them (Yablonski, 2020). A supportive environment improves immediate usability and builds user learning and confidence over time.
  </p>
   <p>
    In conclusion, interface consistency and system feedback are deeply rooted in human psychology and critical to creating usable, intuitive digital products. Jeff Johnson’s cognitive science-based approach in <em>Designing with the Mind in Mind</em> highlights how these principles reduce cognitive effort and error rates by aligning design with human mental models. Jon Yablonski’s <em>Laws of UX</em> complements this perspective by translating psychological laws into actionable design principles that modern UX practitioners can apply. Together, they make a compelling case that consistency and feedback are not mere aesthetic or technical details but essential elements of a user-centered design philosophy that respects and leverages human behavior to enhance usability.
  </p><h3> How Poor Design Creates Unnecessary Cognitive Load</h3>
	<p>Poor design significantly increases cognitive load,it is imperative that designers refrain from making interfaces harder to understand and use. Inconsistent layouts and unclear visual hierarchies force users to expend unnecessary mental effort deciphering interfaces. Users do not want to use a web interface that comes across as confusing. If the website requires too much brain power to understand, the average user will just move to something more familiar.  Johnson also highlights the issue of inattentional blindness, where users focused on a specific task may overlook important information if it's not prominently displayed. UX Designers must understand the importance of designing interfaces that align with users' expectations and cognitive patterns. Jon Yablonski's Laws of UX explores cognitive load by introducing aforementioned principles such as Hick's Law, which states that decision time increases with the amount and complexity of choices. As a UX Designer, neglecting these essential principles can result in interfaces that are taxing on the user's mental resources.</p>
<p>In my own experience, using a poorly designed mobile banking app highlighted these issues. The app had inconsistent hierarchies and lacked clear feedback after I made transactions. This left me feeling uncertain whether the actions I made were completed successfully. Which in turn caused me to double-check my actions, increasing my cognitive load and reducing trust in the app. The feeling of second guessing myself is quite unpleasant and made me feel unintelligent.</p>
<p>	Johnson and Yablonski make it very clear that user-centered design should be used as a tool to minimize cognitive load and align with the cognitive abilities of humans. If choices are simplified, consistency is maintained, and clear feedback is provided, User Experience Designers are equipped with the tools to create interfaces that are intuitive and reduce unnecessary mental effort. Ultimately, acknowledging and addressing cognitive load in design leads to more effective and user-friendly interfaces.</p><p>In user experience (UX) design, managing complexity is a critical challenge. Tesler's Law, also known as the Law of Conservation of Complexity, posits that every system has an inherent amount of complexity that cannot be eliminated. This complexity must be handled either by the system or the user. The goal is to shift as much complexity as possible away from the user and into the system, thereby reducing cognitive load and enhancing usability (<a href="https://lawsofux.com/teslers-law/">Laws of UX</a>).</p><h3> Tesler’s Law in Regard to UX Design</h3>
<p>Furthermore, in the book, Designing with the Mind in Mind, the author Jeff Johnson emphasizes principles that properly align with Tesler's Law. One such principle is the reduction of the user's memory load. Johnson explains that human working memory is limited, and overloading it can lead to errors and frustration. When designers create interfaces that minimize the need for users to remember information across different parts of an application, designers can reduce cognitive strain. Another principle from Johnson's work is the importance of consistency within interface design. Consistent design elements allow users to predict the behavior of the system, which in turn reduces the learning curve and cognitive effort required to interact with the interface. When users encounter familiar patterns, users can transfer knowledge from one part of the system to another, facilitating smoother interactions. Applying Tesler's Law and Johnson's principles together leads to more intuitive and user-friendly designs. For instance, consider a complex form on a website that requires users to input various types of information. By organizing the form into logical sections, providing real-time validation, and using consistent input fields, designers can manage the inherent complexity of the form. A fundamental approach reduces the cognitive load on users, making the form easier to complete and less error-prone.</p>
<p>In conclusion, acknowledging and addressing the inherent complexity in systems is essential for effective User Experience design. By shifting complexity away from users and into the system, and by applying principles such as reducing memory load and maintaining consistency, designers can create interfaces that are both functional and user-friendly. These strategies not only enhance the user experience but also contribute to the overall success of the product.</p>
