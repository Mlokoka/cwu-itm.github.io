            <h3>Model-Based Systems Engineering<h3>
            <p>Model-Based Systems engineering also known as (MSBE) is a formalized application of modeling with the purpose of supporting system requirements, analysis, design, verification and validation activities starting in the conceptual design phase and continuing through development and later life cycle phases. 
Model is a simplified version of a concept, it can be a mathematical, graphical, or physical representation. In this case the objectives of model in Model-Based Systems Engineering is to facilitate understanding, aid in making of decisions, and to explain, control or predict events. Model-Based Engineering is exceedingly important for multiple reasons. Unprecedented levels of systems understanding can be accomplished through integrated analytics. This ties to a model-centric technical baseline. Model-based systems engineering provides mechanisms for driving more engineering depth without increasing the cost. By not imploding the cost this leads to affordability and affordability allows defects to be detected earlier. It is important to model because this drives a consistent specification. Modelling also plays a significant role in analysing and interrogating the system design as well as automating. 
The best way to have a successful model-based approach is scoping the problem. It is important to ask questions such as what does one want to get out of their models? Scoping and managing a modelling effort is an art and a science. The marketplace for MBSE tools has been expanding beyond graphical modeling and requirement tools with a focus on model integration and data. 
By integrating modeling and analysis support for decision makers not only will decision makers have more options and information to draw conclusions. Additionally, the integrated analytics models will increase the amount of information available to decision makers and help them to come to conclusions.By exploring tools, one can visualize and understand a complex tradespace that is rooted in model-based system engineering. This can provide early insight into the impact of decisions including but not limited to technical solutions as well as complex public policies.
The main focus of most current industry efforts is to move closer to a model-based engineering approach focused on integrating data via models. Engineering is the root to understanding all items that could impact a design and determine a resolution for the items. This is also known as an integrated end-to-end modeling environment that supports this. By bringing together different but also related models into a data rich, architecture centric environment, new levels of systems understanding is able to be achieved. Model-based systems engineering forms a way to achieve integration.(INCOSE, n.d.) 
Systems Engineering Demystified goes into detail of the history of systems engineering. Systems engineering has essentially  been around since the beginning of time and has been employed since mankind started building and developing complex systems. Humans have observed complex systems like the solar system ever since the ancient Greeks had first observed the motions of different planets and created models of the geocentric universe. Various examples of systems engineering could also be observed in the second world war. (Holt, 2021) 
Systems can be classified as many different things because there are many different types of systems. Natural systems which are representations of open systems that are characterized beyond the control of humans. These types of systems include but are not limited to weather systems, nature systems, environmental systems, and time systems. 
Another type of system is Designed Physical Systems, and this represents what the majority of people would immediately think when they’re considering a system. Such as tablets, computers, or cameras. The list is almost never ending. The systems will usually be made up of physical artifacts that represent the real world representation of the system. 
There are also Designed Abstract Systems that represent systems that have no physical artifacts but are used by people with the purpose of understanding or even explaining an idea or a concept. Some examples of systems like this would be equations, models, and so on. 
Human Activity Systems are people-based systems that can be observed within the real world. Systems like these are usually made to consist of different sets of people interacting to achieve a common goal and purpose. Examples of Human Activity Systems include but are not limited to social groups, political systems and people-based services.
And Transcendental Systems are systems that surpass humans current understanding. Examples of transcendental systems are unknown problems, numberwang, and deities.
The five different broad types of systems have a common set of characteristics that could be associated with all types of systems. The characteristics allow the various systems to be understood and developed. Every system has its own natural structure and can be considered as a set of interacting system elements. (Holt, 2021)
One of the many key aspects of a system that's essential to understand as a piece of a system are stakeholders that are associated with the system. Understanding stakeholders is exceedingly important to successful systems engineering. Stakeholders are defined as the role of any person, organization, or thing that has an interest in the system. Stakeholders aren’t actually just people but can actually be plenty of other things. Things like organizations, or quite literally anything can be a stakeholder. Stakeholders are outside the boundary of a system and enabling systems. The definition of a stakeholder is anything that has an interest in the system. It should also be noted that an enabling system is essentially a special type of stakeholder. Furthermore, is it exceedingly important to identify stakeholders because different stakeholders will look at the same system in different ways. This widely depends on the role of the stakeholder. Which in turn leads to the importance of context. (Holt, 2021)
Every single system has at least one boundary that is associated with the system. This helps to explain the scope of the system.There are various types of boundaries that include but are not limited to physical boundaries. Physical boundaries are a sort of enclosure that surrounds the system which separates it from the outside world. This would be like  the body of a car. There are also conceptual boundaries, these are boundaries with a non-physical boundary that could be imagined but not actually observed. This could be something like the transmitter and receiver on a satellite. Stakeholder boundaries are different stakeholders which can look at the same system in various ways, which therefore can perceive the boundary of a system which may change depending on the stakeholder. It is exceedingly important to understand which system elements are considered to be inside the boundary of a system and which are considered to be on the external boundary of a system. System elements are considered within the boundary of a system that will help to define exactly which type of system it is. Understanding what's inside the boundary is essential, especially in regard to system elements. Its necessary to to understand what lies outside of the boundary of the system. These would be things that exist outside of the boundary of the systems that are considered as either stakeholders or even enabling systems.Each time an interaction happens across the boundary of a system, it identifies the interface of that system.WHen interfaces are identified as an important part of systems engineering. This means that a boundary could be used to determine all interfaces between a system and the outside world. (Holt, 2021)
Module-based systems engineering is different from traditional engineering methods which rely on text based documents and manual processes. Model-based systems engineering uses digital modeling and simulation to design different systems. The models provide a visual and interactive way to represent system components and the connections between them. This is exceedingly helpful for complex interfaces and systems. It should also be noted that it is easier to update digital models. Because this makes model-based systems engineering more efficient than traditional methods and it adds clarity as well as reduces the risk of error and improves communication 
There are various benefits to Model-based systems engineering. One of the benefits is enhanced communication and collaboration. This is the visual and interactive nature of models that helps different stakeholders understand and contribute to the development process even better. Model-based systems engineering also improves quality and accuracy. This reduces the risk of errors and inconsistencies that are common in systems which are document-centric. This allows greater traceability. Models are necessary for providing a single source of truth which ensures that every single stakeholder is working with the same information that can identify system-level issues efficiently. Model-based systems can also be more complex, but in a good way. They are helpful when it comes to working with a system of systems, or any project that puts the resources of several systems that create a more complex one. This is because MBSE allows clear, intricate relationships, representations, and dependencies within a system. Scalability and flexibility is another benefit of model-based systems engineering. This is because MSE can be adapted to projects that are made of various complexities and sizes. This makes it a versatile approach that is suitable for a wide range of applications. This can also help to support product development through the whole lifecycle of the product.
The main components of MBSE is the systems architecture model also known as SAM. Another component of Model-based systems engineering is the engineering simulation software that determines whether what's inside of the systems architecture model will match the requirements and whether or not it will operate as planned. And a centralized computation that can be cloud-based or physical, which performs every function and stores results. Altogether, these parts make up the digital thread, this ensures that when various updates are made to a model, they’re also updated across every other model in the system. (McGrath & Jonker, 2023)

            <h3>Model Based Systems Engineering & User Experience</h3>
            <p>Now that the reader is already familiar with Model-based Systems Engineering which is the practice of developing a set of related models which help, design,simulate, and document a system that's under development, it is important to be aware of how Model-Based Systems Engineering ties into user experience. The application of modeling systems in a cost-effective way in order to explore and document system characteristics is a colossal part of MBSE. When testing and validating the characteristics of a system early, models can facilitate timely learning of both behaviors and properties. This in turn enables fast feedback on design and requirements decisions. This plays a role into how the user of the developed model ends up experiencing the model. Models provide an effective way to update, explore, and communicate aspects of a system to stakeholders while simultaneously reducing and eliminating dependence on traditional documents significantly. It should be noted that historically Model-Based Systems Engineering has been laser focused on recording and expressing design, analysis, requirements and verification information. As modeling technology continues to mature, it has provided people with increased value by providing users with accelerated learning. This can provide better insights into the physical world (Skaled Agile, Inc., n.d.). This is necessary for evolving live systems and enabling enterprise solution delivery. Enterprise solution delivery is defined as a large solution integration and delivery which describes practices that are required to apply safe principles and practices to the operation, development, specification, and evolution of the worlds biggest and most sophisticated software applications, networks, and cyber-physical systems. (Skaled Agile, Inc., n.d.) Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) and User Experience (UX) design, while the two are traditionally known and viewed as separate disciplines, are increasingly interconnected in the development of complex systems, specifically as the main focus on human-centered design becomes more important to systems thinking. Model-Based Systems Engineering is a formalized methodology that uses models to support the requirements such as, analysis, design, verification, and validation activities throughout the development lifecycle of a system. This shifts the main emphasis from document-based engineering to a model-centric approach. This allows for improved integration, visualization,  and the traceability of complex system components and their interactions. When User Experience design is brought into the fold of Model-Based Systems Engineering, the user can become a central component of the system model. As opposed to being just an afterthought that is addressed during the interface design phase. This integration will ensure that the system’s functionality aligns closely with needs, human behaviors, and limitations from the very start of the design process.	
The influence of psychology in UX, which was spearheaded by influential figures such as Donald Norman and Jane Fulton Suri, plays a crucial role in the integration process. Norman’s foundational perspective on user experience emphasizes the importance of a system being useful, intuitive, and delightful for its users. When applying this within an MBSE framework, this principle leads to systems that are not only technically large but also practically usable. For example, early modeling within Model-Based Systems Engineering is able to incorporate user task flows, cognitive load considerations, and emotional responses, this ensures that the human-machine interface is not only operable but most importantly. optimal. User Experience inputs can guide the architecture of a system by defining human-centric requirements that are able to be traced throughout the system model, this can influence everything from interface design to safety protocols. This approach is especially vital in high-stakes domains like aerospace, defense, and healthcare, this is where human error resulting from poor UX design can have catastrophic consequences.	
Jane Fulton Suri’s human-centered design methodology—anchored in empathy, observation, and cross-functional collaboration—also complements MBSE by encouraging engineers to go beyond technical specifications. Her approach advocates for deeply understanding users in their natural environments, an insight that can be embedded into system models to reflect real-world contexts. Additionally, ethnographic research findings can shape model parameters and behavioral simulations, this ensures that user scenarios and edge cases are considered early in the design. Furthermore, this reduces the need for costly redesigns late in development and improves overall system performance and adoption.
By incorporating User Experience into Model-Based Systems Engineering, this also promotes a more agile development process. As models evolve, models can be continuously validated against User Experience criteria, which allows for rapid feedback and refinement. This dynamic of feedback-driven development cycle is essential for building systems that truly serve users' wants and needs in ever-changing operational environments. With that being said MBSE and UX design are not competing paradigms but rather complementary approaches that, when combined, offer a more holistic and user-aligned system development process. As systems continue to grow in complexity. The interface between human and machine becomes more critical, the collaboration between MBSE and UX which is rooted in the principles of psychology, design thinking, and engineering will define the next generation of systems that are not only efficient but deeply human-centric (Yablonski, 2024).

            <h3>Systems Development Life Cycle Insights</h3>
            <p>​The Systems Development Life Cycle also known as SDLC is a structured approach that's used in software engineering to design, test, develop, and maintain software systems. This planned approach provides a systematic process for building software that ensures quality and accuracy. The Systems Design Life Cycle goes through several phases which include feasibility analysis, planning, development, design, testing, deployment, and maintenance. Every single phase phase has specific deliverables and is meant to ensure that the software meets the desired requirements and functions properly (Wikipedia,2024)
A few commonly used Systems Development Life Cycle models are iterative, linear, and incremental. This offers different methodologies that’re suited for various project needs depending on the situation. The linear model, which is also known as the Waterfall model, follows a strict and precise sequence of phases where each must be completed before the next part of the process can commence. Due to its simplicity and structured nature it is easier to manage,control, and document than other processes. This model is most effective when project requirements are stable and well thought out from the beginning (Wikipedia, 2024). However, a significant drawback is the lack of flexibility once development starts, accommodating changes becomes difficult. Nonetheless, testing occurs deep into the process, this often leads to late-stage discovery of defects. This in turn increases the cost and complexity of fixing issues (Wikipedia, 2024).
With that being said, the iterative model involves developing the system through repeated cycles also known as iterations. This allows for refinement with each cycle. Every single iteration passes through phases such as design, development, planning, and testing. This leads to the promotion of early problem detection and incremental improvement (Ellow.io, 2023). The iteration model supports adaptability and is exceedingly useful when requirements are not fully known. This promotes constant feedback and improvement. Although, the iterative model is able to result in increased project complexity due to overlapping cycles and risks scope creep if these challengers are not properly managed (Ellow.io, 2023).
The incremental model breaks the project into miniature modules or components that are tested, developed, and delivered in different increments. Every single increment builds off one another which results in added functionality to the system that can be delivered independently. This will allow users to access part of the system early (Guru99, 2023). This early delivery of features is beneficial for user feedback and early revenue generation. Although it should be noted that it requires precise planning and integration to confirm that the future modules align with previously delivered components. Additionally, initial architecture must be well rounded to accommodate for ongoing possible future integration (Guru99, 2023).
Thinking in terms of a system’s life cycle is essential for effective system design, as well as sustainability and long-term evolution. The Systems Design Life Cycle offers a well defined plan that grants structure and clarity. Which results in the support of consistent project execution and goal alignment (Guru99, 2023). Looking from a sustainability perspective, practices such as thorough documentation, regular testing, and scheduled maintenance enable the system to be updated and remain functional over time. It's important that digital systems must evolve to meet new user needs and technological advances, an SDLC helps integrate change systematically, ensuring stability during transitions (Ellow.io, 2023).
Nonetheless, using iterative and incremental models supports constant development and refinement, this allows for systems to evolve in response to real-world feedback and changing requirements. In a world that has rapidly changing technological environments, this adaptability is completely necessary.. Without an SDLC approach, teams may struggle with confusing objectives, limited scalability, misaligned timelines, and poor quality control,(Wikipedia, 2024).


</p>
            <h3>SLDC Summarized</h3>
            <p>The Systems Device Life Cycle is a fundamental framework within software development that guides the planning, maintenance, creation, and future retirement of different digital systems. Systems Device Life Cycle provides structured stages that help development teams manage complexity, reduce risk possibility, and enhance project planning. By thoroughly selecting the proper life cycle model. Whether its iterative, linear, or incremental teams are able to align development strategies with the specific challenges and needs of each project. Every single model offers distinct advantages. Linear approaches bring clarity and structure. Iterative models encourage continuous improvement. And incremental methods allow for quicker delivery of functional components. Lifecycle thinking ensures that systems are not only built efficiently but are also designed with long-term sustainability in mind. This perspective becomes increasingly important as technologies improve, evolve and user demands grow more complex and sophisticated. By incorporating lifecycle principles this promotes adaptability, system resilience, and user relevance. Additionally, it encourages proactive system scalability and smoother integration of emerging technologies. In an age of rapid digital transformation, adopting a comprehensive life cycle-oriented approach enables organizations to stay competitive and deliver lasting value through their digital solutions. Systems Device Life Cycle supports both immediate project success and the enduring effectiveness of the systems it helps and hopes to shape.To summarize in a comprehensive manner, the Systems Device Life Cycle serves as a foundational framework within software development. When one takes the time to carefully select among iterative, linear, and incremental models based on the nature of the project and the task that they may face, development teams can manage complexity, reduce risk, improve planning, and support the long-term success and sustainability of digital systems. As technologies and user needs continue to grow, the importance of lifecycle thinking in system design becomes even more apparent, ensuring that digital solutions remain effective, relevant, and resilient over time.
