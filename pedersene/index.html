            <h3>Systems engineering is tracked as far back as the 20th century. They may be seen in the world war or MIT. As time goes on systems are becoming more complex and are growing. Systems can be described in many ways like natural, abstract, physical, human, and transcendental. But systems are not just limited to one and can be complex. Now systems also have elements they interact with and are made up of. Then we have stakeholders who are interested in the system, attributes characterize the system properties, boundaries that define the scope of the system, needs the purpose of the system, constraints limiting the realization of the system. And that is the summary of the system concepts. “Systems Engineering is a multi-disciplinary, common-sense approach that enables the realization of successful systems.”  The three main reasons systems fail are because of complexity, communication, and understanding. Basically, when people do not take the time to identify a problem and communicate it accurately.  </h3>
         </p> Systems thinking as described in the article can be used with the analogy of a car. Using the analogy in the article there is the driver, vehicle itself, and the individual parts. Now applying it to my real-world experience we can use the analogy of rugby. So, in systems thinking we would look at the team as a whole. If we lose a rugby match the system's thinking approach would look at the whole team as the reason for failing. A more traditional thinking approach would look at individual players' mistakes as the cause for failure. As a team and a whole system, we have more than just players, we have coaches and trainers, and we spend lots of time together practicing, lifting, and playing.  And when there's a problem a system's thinking approach looks at all the pieces and how they work together over time, versus linear approach focuses on one aspect at a time.  </p>

               Going back to complex digital systems, it's important to use a model-based approach. Just like in rugby there are multiple players on the field. When looking at digital systems there are multiple components such as software, hardware, and users. Because there are so many different moving components you want to look at complex digital systems as a whole and not just individual parts. As we learn in the article, the goal of digital systems is to develop a successful system in using a model-based approach. It helps ensure that all the components are taken into account rather than must looking into individual pieces. The model-based approach is the blueprint that provides the key details for success.  </p>
