            <h3>Systems Thinking </h3>
            <p>   Systems thinking is a way to understand complex problems by examining the way each part of the systems interacts with another. It differs from traditional linear thinking as there is no one clear path or “solution” in systems thinking, as it focuses on the larger scheme of things and looks at many different paths of action.  

                  Systems-thinking scholar Donella Meadows used a good metaphor in her book Thinking in Systems, when she described the elements of a system as the elements of a tree: roots, trunk, branches, and leaves. These elements are not just sitting in the same place; they play a role with one another and affect one another. </p>
            <h3>Types of Systems </h3>
            <p>   System types classify the nature of the system like natural systems and designed physical systems. Systems engineering can be applied to all types of system. System elements are associated with all system types and help develop and understand them. There are two types of systems: System of interest refers to a system that is under development while an enabling System refers to any System that has an interest in, or interacts with, a System of Interest. When considering any System, or System Element, it is important to understand that they will interact with other System Elements, rather than existing in isolation. In Systems Engineering, everything is connected to something else and so understanding the relationships between System Elements, which form the basis of the interactions between them, is just as important as understanding the System Elements themselves (Holt, 2021). </p>
            <h3>Characteristics of a System </h3>
            <h3>     Stakeholders</h3>
            <p>   Stakeholders define who or what has an interest in the system. They come in many forms and are not always people. Organizations or anything else can also be a stakeholder, they each play a vital role in the system because they each see the system differently. In systems engineering, it is important to identify all stakeholders and their roles. </p>
      
      
            <h3>     Attributes <h3>
            <p>
            Attributes characterize system properties. They can describe the entire system concept, or they can describe other system elements. For example, if the system is a car, attributes could be the fuel type, material, weight, or other dimensions. Each system will have its own unique set of attributes.  </p>
            <h3>     Boundaries <h3>
            <p>   Boundaries define the scope of the system. There are many types of boundaries including the following: 

                  Physical boundaries: An enclosure or barrier that separates the system from the outside work. A car’s outer frame and windows are physical boundaries. A car’s engine block is a physical boundary of the engine which houses all other components.  
   
                   Conceptual boundaries: Abstract or intangible boundaries. The scope of responsibility in a vehicle’s maintenance system is a conceptual boundary. Can it be seen or measured? No. Is there a direct relationship between maintenance and a smooth-running vehicle? Yes. 
   
                   Stakeholder boundaries: The perception of each stakeholder may differ, causing boundaries to change. A passenger might say that the car’s physical boundary is its body. The driver might consider the connection of maintenance and vehicle performance as the boundary. 
   
                   Understanding a system’s boundaries is key. Each interaction across the Boundary of a System is an interface to that System. Identifying interfaces is an important part of Systems Engineering, and a Boundary can be used to identify all interfaces between a System and the outside world. </p>
            <h3>     Needs <h3>
            <p>   
            Needs, simply put, are the purposes of a system. There are different types of needs: requirements, features and goals. Requirements are the desired outcomes the system provides. A car being able to shift gears, stop when the driver presses the brake, and turn are requirements of a vehicle system. Features are needs which surpass just specific functions and describe a broader set of functions working together. In the car example, features could be keyless entry, GPS or Bluetooth connectivity. Goals are an even higher level need which guides the design, development, and evaluation of all features and components in the car system. One goal of an electric car is to minimize environmental impact like carbon emissions, fuel use and pollution (Holt, 2021). </p>
            <h3>     Constraints </h3>
            <p>   Constraints are the limitations that a system must operate within. These can affect how a system is designed, developed, and implemented. Constraints define the boundaries of what is possible or acceptable. They can come from the environment, technical limitations, human factors, or regulations. Consider the car system, an environmental constraint that designers must consider is car must be able to function in extreme weather which affects material and component choices (Holt, 2021). 

               Systems thinking incorporates all the elements and components discussed and focuses on how they interact with each other. It requires a mindset shift: expanding your thinking about what constitutes problem-solving and reframing problem spaces. </p>
            <h3>Systems Engineering </h3>
            <p>According to Holt and Perry, systems engineering can be defined as “a multi-disciplinary, common-sense approach that enables the realization of successful systems (Holt & Perry, 2019). To expand upon that definition, Holt 2021 explains there are a few factors that must be kept in mind: 

               Systems Engineering is a multidisciplinary approach that considers all engineering areas, including mechanical, electrical, civil, software, and so on. Crucially, however, it should also be recognized that Systems Engineering is not just limited to engineering disciplines, but includes many other diverse areas, such as management, mathematics, physics, psychology, and about any other area!  
               
                
               
                Systems Engineering is applied across a system's life cycle and is not restricted to any single stage. This means that Systems Engineering is considered right from the point in time that the very first idea for the System is conceived until the System is retired. Even when working on a single stage, it is important that all stages of the life cycle are considered.  
               
                
               
               Systems Engineering does not remove the need for intelligence, as systems engineers must never blindly follow instructions and require a healthy dose of common sense to be effective. 
               
               Jon Holt emphasizes that systems engineering exists to manage complexity, improve communication, and ensure understanding. If neglected, these three areas lead to major system failures. As systems grow in scale and technological depth, traditional systems engineering becomes more difficult to manage using documents and disconnected tools (Holt, 2021). 
               
               As systems like modern cars evolve to include countless interconnected hardware and software components, the limitations of traditional systems engineering approaches become clear. Managing such complexity demands more than just documents and spreadsheets—it requires a unified, dynamic, and structured way to model the system as a whole. This is where Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) comes into play. </p>
            <h3>Model-Based Systems Engineering </h3> 
            <p>  Since working on my first systems map, I’ve pondered how people can manage and work on these systems given their complexity, and how long it takes to develop a working one. Model Based Systems Engineering or MBSE approach provides the framework that enables the realization of successful systems while managing their complexity and allowing all relevant aspects of the system to be understood in a simple way. 

               Traditional systems engineering is based upon the documents which describe the system. MBSE is based on the model that abstracts the system. Using models is a way of simplifying the system without changing anything, while focusing on only the necessary information that leads to the system’s overall success. Each model is made up of several different views which contain valuable information. What makes the information valuable and therefore necessary? Thinking back to the stakeholders is one way to test this. Earlier I explained how stakeholder’s views are a core principle in systems thinking. MBSE by extension supports this principle by designing models with each stakeholder’s views in mind. For example, a user might be most concerned with usability and accessibility while a manager is concerned about cost efficiency and functionality. MBSE helps streamline the process by gathering multiple different views from the people that matter, right from the start (Holt, 2021). </p>  
            <h3>Why a Model-Based Approach Is Crucial for Complex Digital Systems </h3>
            <p>Digital systems are growing faster than ever before in terms of complexity and structure. They often involve hardware, software, networks, data flows, and user interfaces, all interacting in real time. Managing this complexity using traditional document-based methods just does not work anymore. That is where a model-based approach becomes not just helpful, but necessary. For example, one of the most widely used digital systems is cloud computing. A cloud-based application involves several smaller systems, each running on different servers and sharing data. A model can show how they are connected, what data is exchanged, and where the risks or bottlenecks are (Holt, 2021). 

               Another advantage of the MBSE approach in designing digital systems is engineers can test performance virtually before prototypes are built. This allows issues to be identified early on (Holt, 2021). </p>
            <h3>
               Putting it All Together <h3> 
            <p>In today’s evolving world, the problems we face are no longer simple or isolated, but complex and interconnected. Traditional linear thinking focuses on straight paths, cause-and-effect chains, and isolated components. This approach falls short when applied to complex digital systems where every element is connected, and changes in one part affect it all. 

               Systems thinking offers a more holistic perspective by focusing on relationships, feedback loops, and the synergistic interactions between elements. It encourages us to see the bigger picture, consider multiple viewpoints, and embrace complexity rather than shy away from it. 
               
               Model-Based Systems Engineering is a natural extension of this mindset. Rather than relying only on documents, MBSE uses models that reflect the system’s structure, behavior, and stakeholder needs. It enables engineers and decision-makers to visualize complexity, collaborate effectively, and make smarter choices throughout the system’s lifecycle. 
               
               As digital systems continue to grow in complexity, it is essential for designing systems that are not only functional, but sustainable, adaptable, and aligned with the needs of everyone involved. </p>

            </header>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
                  <p>Have you ever wondered how apps, software, or even automated checkout systems come to life? These are all results of carefully planned system development processes. We interact with many systems every day in nature, in our homes, in our places of work and in retail stores. Systems are used in many different contexts. So, a system is an interconnecting network of parts that work together thereby creating a larger whole of a complex thing (Das et al., 2022).
                     From your favorite food delivery app to the checkout kiosk at your local grocery store—every digital tool we rely on is part of a broader system. But what does it really mean to develop a system? To understand how these systems are designed, maintained, and evolve over time, we turn to the Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC). </p>
            <h2>Systems Development Lifecycle</h2>
                  <p>The systems development lifecycle is a fundamental process that models how each system behaves throughout various stages. A system is conceived, developed, used, maintained, and eventually retired. The Lifecycle has six stages:</p>   
            <dl>
               <dt>Conception:</dt>
               <dd>
                  What the system needs to do, based on stakeholders needs. Stakeholder input is gathered to define the system’s goals, requirements, and desired outcomes. This is where the "why" of the system is established, often through interviews, surveys, and problem analysis. 
               </dd>
               <dt>Development:</dt>
               <dd>
                  Teams brainstorm, model, and prototype possible solutions, often comparing different technologies or approaches. This stage may involve feasibility studies and early technical design.
               </dd>
               <dt>Production:</dt>
               <dd>
                  Building and testing the actual system for usability. Developers write the code or build the physical components, and QA teams test for functionality, usability, and reliability. 
               </dd>
               <dt>Utilization:</dt>
               <dd>
                  Actively working with the system in a real-world environment. Feedback from real usage is collected, and the system’s performance is monitored to ensure it meets user needs and operational goals.
               </dd>
               <dt>Support:</dt>
               <dd>
                  Keeping the system running smoothly. Maintenance and troubleshooting happen simultaneously with utilization.
               </dd>
               <dt>Retirement:</dt>
               <dd>
                  The system is decommissioned and safely disposed of. This stage includes transferring data if necessary and disposing of or archiving components responsibly. Retirement may also involve transitioning users to a new system.
                  </dd>
            </dl>
            <p>These stages provide a flexible yet structured path to guide system evolution. Not every system follows the same steps in the same order—some stages may overlap, repeat, or be skipped depending on the project’s size and complexity (Holt, 2021). </p>
            <h2>Life Cycle Models</h2>
                  <p>While a life cycle is a structural concept, a life cycle model is described by Holt as “a behavioral construct that describes the execution of a Life Cycle, specifically the order of execution of the stages” (Holt, 2021). Depending on the project, there are a few well established Life Cycle Models that may be used and are described next, with their advantages and possible shortcomings.</p>

               <h3>Linear</h3>
            <p>In a linear model each stage happens right after the next, with a cascading effect. Because of the specific sequence of this model, it is best used for projects where the needs, products and technology involved are not likely to change much. With little variation in the processes in each stage, it is used primarily for well-defined projects with straightforward requirements and tight constraints, such as simple applications with critical, non-negotiable functions. One advantage of Linear models is they are easy to understand and a clear process application. The system is not beneficial for large complex systems where the needs tend to change often. Linear life cycle models are typically not used for systems engineering (Holt, 2021). </p>
               <h3>Iterative</h3>
            <p>The iterative model uses several passes through the stages, or iterations, which break down large complex projects into smaller ones. Think of it as creating a sculpture, the main need is defined then refined through feedback and testing. Each iteration, or pass is a mini life cycle. Because each iteration goes through each stage, they are each workable versions of the final system. This system is beneficial because iterations are shorter and having more versions means more opportunities for improvement. Also, with multiple versions it is easier to restore and find bottlenecks or errors. Iterative systems can produce new versions relatively quickly, an advantage in the software industry. A common example of the iterative model is Agile development, where each sprint produces a working version of the software that incorporates user feedback. According to Jon Holt in Systems Engineering Demystified, “one of the disadvantages of applying an iterative approach to Systems Projects is that the basic needs may be changed quite frequently by Stakeholders, so it is important to have a good, robust needs Process in place, which is often not the case” (Holt, 2021). Iterative models allow space for learning from feedback and evolving understanding of needs.</p>
               <h3>Incremental</h3>
            <p>Incremental and iterative models are sometimes called evolutionary Life Cycle Models because of the multiple passes and releases. In the incremental system, the main focus is adding functionality in smaller increments. This approach allows the project to be built and delivered part by part. The incremental model is like building a house room by room, finishing one before moving on to the next. This method is ideal in complex projects where functionality is needed before the whole project is completed. However not all systems can be worked on or broken down into chunks. For example, some security systems require all components to function together from the beginning, making it harder to implement incrementally (Holt, 2021).</p>
            <h2>Reflection on Systems Thinking </h2> 
                  <p>By viewing development through the lens of systems thinking, we not only build smarter software, but we also build smarter teams, better user experiences, and more adaptable organizations. The Software Development lifecycle that I mentioned earlier is a great example of how systems thinking is utilized in a real-world scenario. It turns an idea into reality and at the end, enables the user to enjoy the intent and presence of an application/product. Although the primary purpose of software development is to serve its users a usable experience, why do so many applications fail to meet customer satisfaction levels? Systems thinking helps us find the reasons and possible routes to better outcomes. </p>
               <h3>Continuous Testing</h3>
            <p>As we saw in the explanations of the three systems lifecycle models, each phase is essential and breaking work into manageable stages like development, testing, and production promotes organized development. The life cycle helps ensure that user needs and goals are clearly defined from the start, and systems thinking includes checks and feedback loops that help catch issues early and improve quality. Thinking ahead through the entire life cycle avoids short-term fixes that create long-term problems.  

               In an example from Systems Thinking, a process for problem solving the author states “It is also necessary to take care how well the flow operates through the system. Doing so enables the teams to remove constraints or bottlenecks in the systems by making them visible with the help of measuring the queue time. Let us take an example, by measuring rate of test case execution or test coverage we can say manual testing would be an obvious constraint in testing phase which will lead to delay in production. The solution could be implementing Continuous Testing that facilitates automated testing, allowing test team to reduce the cycle time in Testing phase” (Das et al., 2022). </p>
               <h3>Adapting to Change</h3> 
            <p>In an IT project lifecycle, user needs increase or change, new technologies and regulations emerge, and systems rarely stay static. A life cycle mindset encourages continuous evaluation and improvement, making it easier to evolve the system without starting over. We saw in the iterative model how useful this method can be for the ever-changing nature of digital systems which must stay relevant, secure, and effective over time. In the workplace, systems thinking also plays a role in productivity and collaboration among teams and projects.</p>   
               <h3>Sustainability</h3>
            <p>The goal should always be envisioning the future and bringing it into being, no matter the complexity of the system, model or framework applied. Sustainable IT practice has emerged as a crucial enabler of environmental stewardship and responsible business practices. A study by Seegrün 2023 and others looks at the development of “Digital Twins, virtual replicas of a product or product-service system, which can be used to provide transparency of a product’s sustainability and to positively influence the ecological impact throughout its lifecycle by means of intelligent data analytics” (Seegrün et al., 2023). For example, in smart manufacturing, a digital twin of a factory floor allows engineers to test energy-saving configurations before applying them in real life, reducing both cost and environmental impact. This unique innovation allows us to simulate and optimize real world scenarios without the cost and waste of physical trial and error. The production and use of digital twins enhance the sustainability of digital systems by enabling smarter design, reducing waste, improving efficiency, and supporting long-term, adaptable solutions. Companies must prepare to take on more responsibility for their products' entire lifecycle, and DTs can increasingly support this responsibility.</p>
            <h2>Final Thought </h2>
                  <p>Understanding the systems' development life cycle and choosing the right model gives us the tools to build better, smarter, and more sustainable digital systems. With the right model and mindset, we can: </p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>Build more user-focused solutions</li>
                     <li>Respond faster to change</li>
                     <li>Design with sustainability in mind</li>
                  </ul> 
            <p>Whether it's through continuous testing, iterative feedback, or innovative tools like digital twins, systems thinking helps us meet the needs of today while preparing for the challenges of tomorrow. </p>

            </header>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
               <p>Have you ever wondered why people are so loyal to Apple products? Once someone switches to an iPhone or Mac, they rarely go back. That is no accident. Apple has mastered the art of human-centered design—a process that puts people’s needs, behaviors, and perceptions at the core of every decision. This post explores what it really means to design for people by examining perception, visual hierarchy, UX laws, usability testing and the distinct approaches of ISO 9241-210 and IDEO’s Field Guide to Human-Centered Design.</p>
               <p>
                  <a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines ">Find out more about Apple's Designs</a>
               </p>
            <h2>Human Centered Design</h2>
               <p>Human centered design is a method of design where human nature is the framework for building user friendly experiences. Taking the time to first understand the psychology behind our natural mental models—internal representations of how things work based on past experiences, helps designers create intuitive products for users. It allows them to easily transfer their knowledge from one product or experience to another, without the need to first take the time to understand how the new system works. As Yablonski (2024) states in Laws of UX, “the discovery that designing better technology meant adapting to humans and all our idiosyncrasies and limitations, rather than forcing us to adapt to a rigid system that must be operated in a specific way, laid the foundation for what we know now as “human-centered design.” It is a lesson that we must continuously remind ourselves, to design better technology means to design for humans, and to design for humans means to anticipate our emotions, limitations, and preconceptions” (Yablonski, 2024).</p>
            <h2>The 4 Laws of UX </h2>
               <p>Jablonski expands upon the value of familiarity in design by introducing one of the 4 Laws of UX, Jakob’s Law. It states that users tend to over time become accustomed to websites they have seen before or use often. Eventually they come to expect similar design conventions. What this means for designers is that there is no need to reinvent the wheel. Instead, aligning with familiar conventions helps users achieve their goals faster. For instance, when Apple releases iOS updates, the changes are subtle and well-integrated. Users rarely have to relearn how to navigate their phone, which supports usability by working with mental models rather than against them.</p>
               <p>Apple launched a feature called Reachability, which enables users to quickly bring items at the top of the screen down to the lower half of the screen with a simple gesture. It effectively enables easy access to parts of the screen with one hand without the user getting a cramp from excessive thumb movement on a larger phone screen. As Fitt’s Law states, the size and distance of a target directly affects the time it takes for a user to acquire it (Jablonski, 2024). </p>
               <p>Another critical concept when designing for human limitations is Miller’s Law. Miller’s Law States that people have a limited working memory. When designing for people, this means that organizing content into smaller clusters helps users process, understand, and memorize easily. The information environment that is Apple’s online store shows products and descriptions one at a time, with optional tabs for more information.  </p>
               <p>The simplicity of Apple’s design from their website to the smart TV remote exemplifies user friendly experience. This principle also supports Hick’s Law, which reminds us that the time it takes to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices available. This concept is important in user centered design because it is an underlying factor in everything we do. The less the user must think about what they need to do to reach their goal, the more likely it is they will achieve it (Jablonski, 2024). These design choices reflect more than just aesthetic preferences; they are rooted in how we perceive and interact with information. To understand this better, we need to look at how perception and visual hierarchy shape our experience. </p>
            <h2>Visual Hierarchy and Perception</h2>
               <p>While laws like Jakob’s and Fitts’s help define effective design, the way we see and interpret information also plays a significant role in usability. Visual hierarchy is important for usability because it affects how our minds perceive the data in front of us. For example, in Designing with the Mind in Mind, the author relays how Gestalt principles of design come into play with usability. When navigating a webpage, visual hierarchy is strategically used to show us what is most important first such as the website banner or headings. Next, sublevel information is organized by level of importance, with subheadings and data categorically placed within the webpage (Johnson, 2020).</p>
               <p>Human perception and understanding in information environments as well as in the world are based off the way our minds organize information into patterns and shapes. Perception of lines and spacing can also help us navigate the data faster and easier. The same way the proximity of street signs and lanes direct us to our destination, navigation markers like buttons in an information environment are grouped in a way that makes sense to us. A forward and back button are always placed next to each other to easily flip through pages, and we expect those types of functions to be consistent across any information environment. By making use of familiar patterns and conventions, shopping sites can effectively keep customers focused on the important stuff—finding and purchasing products (Johnson, 2020).</p>
            <h2>Usability Testing</h2>
               <p>Understanding users also requires observing them in action. Usability testing is a key part of human-centered design because it reveals how real users interact with a product, not just how designers think they will. There are several categories of usability testing like qualitative or quantitative, moderated or unmoderated, remote or in-person, with even more methods in each category. The contextual inquiry method involves observing people in their natural contexts, such as their office or home, as they interact with the product the way they would usually do. The researcher watches how users perform their activities and asks them questions to understand the reasons behind those actions. By watching people use a design, teams can uncover pain points, misunderstandings, or inefficiencies that might not be obvious during development. These insights allow teams to iterate and improve the design before launch, ensuring that the final product truly supports user needs and behaviors (Maze, 2024).</p>
               <p>Usability testing is a bridge between design intent and real-world experience. It keeps users at the center of the process by prioritizing how something works in practice, not just in theory. It also reinforces empathy—seeing firsthand where users struggle helps designers build better, more human-centered solutions.</p>

               </p>
            <h2>ISO 9241-210 and IDEO’s Field Guide</h2>
               <p>All of these principles—mental models, UX laws, and perception—point to one central idea: good design starts with empathy. Two well-known frameworks take different but complementary approaches to this idea. When it comes to designing with people in mind, both ISO 9241-210 and IDEO’s Field Guide to Human-Centered Design offer powerful but different ways to center empathy in the process. ISO 9241-210 approaches human-centered design from a systems and usability standpoint. It emphasizes understanding the user’s context, involving them throughout the design process, and ensuring the final product is not only functional but also usable (2024). On the other hand, IDEO’s Field Guide brings empathy to the forefront by encouraging designers to immerse themselves in people’s lives, listen to their stories, and co-create solutions. It is less about rules and more about perspective—seeing the world through someone else’s eyes to uncover insights that spark innovation (2015). While ISO provides the rigor needed for complex systems, IDEO brings the heart needed for meaningful human connection. Together, they remind us that useful design starts with walking in someone else’s shoes—and then using that understanding to build something better.</p>

            <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
               <p>Designing for people means more than making things look good—it means making them feel intuitive, accessible, and responsive to human needs. Whether you follow the formal principles of ISO or the immersive practices of IDEO, the goal is the same: understand people first, then build with them in mind. The better we understand how people think, feel, and behave, the better experiences we can create. Most importantly, usability testing ensures that this theory translates into practice. By watching and listening to users, we stay grounded in real human experience—turning empathy into action and great design into meaningful solutions.</p>

               <h1>Module 2.2 Blog Post</h1>
            </header>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
               <p>In today’s digital landscape, the usability of a system—its intuitiveness, efficiency, and overall user satisfaction—is of the utmost importance. A system’s usability is closely tied to how effectively it accommodates human cognitive processes, including perception, memory, and behavior. This blog post investigates the foundational elements that make digital systems usable by examining the roles of memory, habits, and mental shortcuts in shaping user interactions. Drawing on principles from human-computer interaction and supported by real-world scenarios, we will explore how consistency, feedback, and cognitive alignment reduce user effort and enhance the digital experience. </p>

                </figure>
            <h2>Perception and Mental Models</h2>
               <p>Before users can interact with a system effectively, they must first make sense of what they’re seeing. Perception shapes how users interpret what’s on a screen. Users don’t scan screens randomly, they are goal oriented, often following what Chi et al. (2001) and Nielsen (2003) call the “scent of information.” They gravitate toward elements that match their expectations or intentions, guided by past experiences and habits. </p>
               <p>These expectations form part of a user's mental model—an internal representation of how they believe a system works. If a system behaves in ways that align with that model, interaction feels seamless. But when labels, icons, or workflows contradict expectations, the disconnect can cause hesitation, confusion, or errors. Designers must anticipate user goals and align interface elements clearly to reduce errors and preserve trust. </p>
               <P>Furthermore, users often project their experiences from previous systems onto new ones. For example, someone familiar with desktop email interfaces may struggle when using a mobile app if key functions are not where they expect them. When systems deviate from well-established conventions without explanation or guidance, they increase the likelihood of user errors and dissatisfaction. </P>

                </figure>
            <h2>Working Memory and Cognitive Load </h2> 
               <p>Understanding perception and mental models leads naturally to a discussion of memory and more specifically, working memory. For the purpose of user-interface design, the most important type of short-term memory is what psychologists call “working memory.” It is not a separate memory store but rather everything we are paying attention to at a given time. Human working memory is limited, typically five (plus or minus one) pieces of information at a time (Johnson, 2021). Designers must respect this limit by keeping interfaces simple and avoiding distractions that steal attention from the user’s main goal. For instance, with what we now know about human memory and attention, we see how computers that use speech output for lengthy segments will overload a user’s working memory. Think of trying to absorb audiobook instructions while navigating traffic. Similarly, when interfaces require users to remember multiple passwords or steps without prompts, they increase the mental load unnecessarily. </p> 
               <p>I experienced this firsthand working at a bank call center. Customers were required to remember a "verbal password" to verify their identity. Most could not recall it, especially if they had not contacted the bank in months. The system treated phone and online banking as separate, requiring different credentials. In a similar experience , Schrage 2020 explains how these unreasonable demands on people’s long-term memory counteract the security and productivity that computer-based applications supposedly provide as users: place sticky notes on or near computers or “hide” them in desk drawers; l contact customer support to recover passwords they cannot recall; use passwords that are easy for others to guess; and set up systems with no login requirements at all or with one shared login and password (Schrage, 2020).  </p> 
            <h2> Cognitive Bias and User Experience </h2>
               <p>Memory and perception are also shaped by cognitive biases—systematic ways in which people deviate from rationality in judgment (Yablonski, 2024). Since much of user centered design involves perception, it is important to realize how bias also contributes to learning how to design with the mind in mind. Yablonski talks about the Memory Bias or Peak End Rule, a cognitive bias which impairs the recollection of memories. It states that we remember the highly emotional parts of events more than the less emotional parts. Designers can leverage this by making key moments like onboarding, confirmations, or task completions especially positive.</p> 
               <p>Similarly, the human brain has a tendency to register and remember negative events more frequently. This is known as the negativity bias. When systems fail or behave unpredictably, those moments dominate the user’s memory. In terms of user interface design, leveling out the inevitable negative experiences is key. One way to mitigate this is by turning the setbacks into opportunity. For example, real-time authentication tools reduce password frustration by using biometrics or single sign-on systems, replacing failure-prone steps with seamless alternatives. By paying close attention to these key moments of an experience, we can ensure users recollect the experience positively (Yablonski, 2024).</p> 
            <h2>Consistency, Feedback, and the Principle of Least Astonishment </h2>
               <p>Just as perception and memory guide our expectations, consistent system behavior reinforces them. Users build habits and expectations over time, and learning these through system feedback usability testing is essential in creating an enjoyable experience. Consistency is a fundamental principle for usable interfaces. Users want the response to a given action to be what they expected, otherwise the response is unwanted. This is known as the Principle of Least Astonishment. A system should behave in a way that least surprises the user. With consistency in design, users can tap into the mental models they have already built to get through the system quicker without needing to re-learn as much or troubleshoot on the fly. One example is the use of the trashcan icon. In every software program and application, this means to delete or archive something. If someone clicked a trash can icon, and the software suddenly shared it instead, the user will end up frustrated and even angry (Yablonski, 2024). </p>
               <p>The Principle of Least Astonishment is a good design principle because it tells us what to do, but this principle does not tell us how to determine which design alternative will surprise users less. A designer can say they have made every button or menu do what they think they user will expect, but ultimately, we need the user’s perspective to make the final design decision. This is where system feedback and usability are needed. In his article Achieving and Balancing Consistency in User Interface Design, Zuschlag explains: “Generative user research can tell us what users expect in a user interface and how surprised they would be if it did something inconsistent with their previous experience. Usability testing lets us directly observe where and how our user interfaces surprise users or otherwise thwart their goals” (Zuschlag, 2010). </p>

                </figure>
               <P>The more consistent the operation of different functions, or the more consistent the actions on different types of objects, the less users have to learn. User interfaces that have many exceptions and little consistency from one function or object to another require users to store in their long-term memory many features about each function or object and its correct usage context. The need to encode more features makes such user interfaces harder to learn. It also makes it more likely that a user’s memory will drop essential features during storage or retrieval, increasing the chances that the user will fail to remember, misremember, or make other memory errors (Johnson, 2021).</P>
            <h2>Tesler’s Law and Shifting Complexity </h2>
               <p>Ultimately, these usability challenges stem from a common root: complexity. Tesler’s Law, or the Law of Conservation of Complexity, states that every system has inherent complexity—it cannot be eliminated, but it can be moved. Designers must decide whether that complexity will burden the user or be handled by the system. Great design takes on that burden. It might mean more development time or more backend logic, but it frees the user to focus on their goal without navigating excessive options, remembering obscure rules, or making constant corrections (Yablonski, 2024). </p>
               <p>Shifting complexity appears where autocomplete functions or intelligent defaults simplify the user’s journey. A form with auto-populated fields, drop-down suggestions, or real-time validation minimizes user input and prevents errors, offloading complexity onto the backend systems that anticipate needs. Instead of forcing users to remember formatting rules or spell product names precisely, the system does the heavy lifting. </p> 
               <p>Another example is responsive web design. In earlier eras, users were responsible for resizing browser windows or downloading mobile-specific apps. Today, designers use CSS grids and media queries to adapt layouts automatically across devices. The user does less; the system does more.</p>
            <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
               <p>The usability of digital systems depends on their ability to align with how people perceive, remember, and interact with information. By respecting the constraints of human cognition, such as limited working memory, literal perception, and predictable biases, designers can create systems that reduce cognitive load and promote a seamless user experience. Principles such as Tesler’s Law, the Principle of Least Astonishment, and research from cognitive psychology highlight the importance of shifting complexity away from the user and fostering consistency, clarity, and responsiveness. When systems accommodate the human mind rather than challenge it, they become not only functional but genuinely intuitive and engaging. </p>

            </header>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
               <p>Great UX design isn’t just about aesthetics or functionality, it is about aligning digital interfaces with how the human brain naturally processes information. By understanding core psychological principles, designers can create smoother, more intuitive experiences. This post explores how key concepts from cognitive science influence visual and interaction design in ways that guide user behavior and enhance usability. </p>
               <p>In today’s digital world, where users interact with dozens of apps and platforms daily, the ability to reduce cognitive friction is critical. Understanding mental models, attention triggers, and the emotional aspect of design allows developers to meet users where they are, streamlining decisions and creating lasting impressions. </p>
            <h2>Automatic Cognitive Processing- Old and New Brain or Systems 1 & 2 </h2>
               <p>Human cognition operates through two neural “systems”: System 1, which is fast, intuitive, and automatic, and System 2, which is slower, analytical, and requires more effort. In everyday life, and especially in digital environments, System 1 does most of the hard work. It helps users rapidly scan interfaces, identify important information, and make snap judgments, often without conscious awareness. This automatic processing is easier and sufficient for navigating routine tasks, which is why the brain prefers it unless a situation demands deeper analysis (Johnson, 2020). </p>
               <img src="images/cognition.avif" alt="Human with brain implant interacting with a virtual interface" width="600">
               <p style="font-size: 0.8em; color: gray;">
                Image by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@alexshuper" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alex Shuper</a>, published on October 29, 2024 via <a href="https://unsplash.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unsplash</a>.
               </p>
               <p>Since users rely heavily on System 1 when interacting with digital interfaces, first impressions, visual hierarchy, and intuitive layout are critical. Users form lasting opinions about a website or app within milliseconds, primarily based on visual aesthetics and ease of use. These judgments influence not just engagement, but also credibility and trust. A Stanford Web Credibility study found that 75% of users admit to making judgments about a company’s credibility based on its website’s design (Fuhr, 2023). If an interface is cluttered, unintuitive, or requires too much cognitive effort, System 2 is triggered, and users may disengage (Yablonski, 2024). For instance, when filling out a complex tax form or troubleshooting an error message, users must rely on the analytical nature of System 2 thinking, highlighting the need for clear instructions and support tools. </p>
               <h3>First Impressions Matter </h3>
               <img src="images/UXdesign.avif" alt="Colorful 3D UX design icons" width="600">
               <p style="font-size: 0.8em; color: gray;">

               </p>
               <p>Therefore, effective UX design should cater to System 1 by prioritizing clarity, consistency, and immediate visual cues, while reserving complexity for moments when deeper interaction is necessary. Ultimately, aligning interface design with the brain’s natural processing habits improves usability, satisfaction, and overall user engagement. One of the most immediate applications of System 1 processing is in how users form first impressions. These judgments happen almost instantly and are influenced heavily by how a site or app looks and feels upon first glance. Because these snap judgments are governed by System 1, visual appeal plays a disproportionately large role in shaping user perception—especially in the crucial first moments. </p>
            <h2>Aesthetic- Usability Effect</h2>
               <p>When considering user centered design, the way the system works is equally as important as how it looks. However, an aesthetically pleasing design can influence usability and user perception. Yablonski (2023) states “an aesthetically pleasing design creates a positive response in people’s brains and leads them to believe the design actually works better—a phenomenon known as the aesthetic–usability effect” (Yablonski, 2023). </p>
               <p>The aesthetic usability effect has limits. A beautiful design can make users forgive minor usability problems, but not all. Consider this excerp from a usability study of Arcadis, a consultancy website. Arcadis used large, visually appealing images throughout its site. Initially, a study participant appreciated the photos; however, he eventually became annoyed by the site’s low information density when he could not find what he was looking for. When functionality is sacrificed for aesthetics, users tend to lose patience (Moran, 2024). Beyond aesthetics, users are also driven by pattern recognition and attention cues. Designers can harness these instincts to make important content stand out—this is where the Von Restorff Effect comes into play. </p>
            <h2>Von Restorff Effect </h2>
               <p>Users are driven by instinctual goals rooted in human survival behavior. What is more is we possess superior pattern processing capabilities, and can identify objects in fractions of a second, and we have an innate ability to spot slight differences in objects. These instinctual abilities affect how we view the world around us, and how we view information environments. This phenomenon is known in the design world as the Von Restorff Effect- when multiple similar objects are present, the one that differs from the rest is most likely to be remembered (Johnson, 2020). </p>
               <p>When it comes to digital interfaces, this means that contrasting elements draw our attention and hold in our memories longer. In the design process, visual emphasis can be used to draw the attention of users quickly toward achieving their goal. Color, shape, size, position, and motion all affect the attention of users, and should be carefully considered when building interfaces. Consider Google’s homepage, it is predominantly white, but the colorful logo and vibrant search button grab attention immediately (Checker, 2024). Additionally, small animations like a loading spinner or hover effect can subtly communicate progress or interactivity without overwhelming the user. These moments, though brief, enhance usability and support pattern recognition in visual processing. </p>

               <p>The visual differentiation in buttons, text links and notifications help grab user’s attention and direct them to completing tasks and avoid completing the wrong tasks. When you see a red button, you are automatically thinking ‘delete, cancel, stop’ and are careful to read the text more than you would if it were all the same color. Used in moderation, contrasting colors and visual cues for those that are color blind are effective in directing users to the most relevant content. While the Von Restorff Effect can be powerful, overusing it can dilute its impact. If everything is designed to stand out, nothing will truly be distinctive (Checker, 2024). While visual cues capture attention, flexibility in how users interact with an interface is equally important. This is where Postel’s Law becomes critical. </p>

            <h2>Postel’s Law </h2>   
               <p>Even when a designed interface is intuitive and user friendly, we are still designing for humans which means there will be a level of emotion that we need to prepare for. There will be errors, distractions and inconsistencies that must be accepted early on. To provide a system that satisfies user expectations, the design must be adaptable and forgiving, considering emotional variability and human error. Think of a door handle that works whether you push or pull, it accommodates user error without penalty. Postel’s Law gives us a guiding principle for designing human-centric experiences that account for both scale and complexity. </p>
               <p>Postel’s Law suggests designers to “be conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from others.” In other words, be empathetic to, flexible about, and tolerant of any of the various actions the user could take or any input they might provide (Yablonski, 2024). Consider the flexibility of a system with its respective users. If a computer system can receive and translate human information into a computer readable format in a variety of ways, the more resilient the design will be. </p>
               <p>Apple’s face recognition feature is an example of Postel’s Law in action, allowing an easier way for users to unlock their phones instead of entering a password each and every time. Another example is responsive design, which relies on “fluid grids, flexible images, and media queries to create websites that allow content to respond in a fluid manner to different viewing contexts” (Yablonski 2024). In my experience, websites that cannot adapt to different viewing modes are frustrating and illogical. My timecard website works well if I am on my laptop, but if I try to view it on my phone, the text and buttons overlap with each other making it almost impossible to click on the correct spot. The system is usable, but inconvenient as the laptop website is separate from the cell phone website. Now that CSS capability is more common, designers can create seamless web experiences across all devices from a smart watch to a TV screen. This kind of flexibility is especially important for accessibility. Systems that adapt to screen readers, voice input, and alternative navigation tools reflect Postel’s principle by recognizing that users will interact with technology in varied ways, sometimes due to ability, environment, or context. This web design strategy is accepting a broad spectrum of input while providing output that is reliably adaptable and not quarantined to specific dimensions or devices. </p>
            <h2>Final Thoughts </h2>
               <p>Understanding the cognitive mechanisms that govern human behavior is essential to creating effective digital experiences. By designing interfaces that align with automatic cognitive processes—such as those described by dual-system theories—we can reduce user friction and enhance intuitive interaction. Concepts like the Von Restorff Effect and Postel’s Law further underscore the importance of visual differentiation and system flexibility in supporting user needs. Moreover, applying these principles not only enhances the user experience, but also correlates with increased retention, customer satisfaction, and brand loyalty. In a marketplace saturated with competing interfaces, small cognitive advantages can translate into big user outcomes. </p>
               <p>Ultimately, thoughtful UX design is not solely about aesthetics or functionality, but about anticipating and accommodating the ways in which users perceive, process, and respond to information. When interface design is informed by cognitive science, it promotes usability, fosters engagement, and contributes to a more seamless, satisfying user experience. </p>
