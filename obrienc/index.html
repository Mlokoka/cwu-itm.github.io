            <h3>Systems Thinking </h3>
            <p>   Systems thinking is a way to understand complex problems by examining the way each part of the systems interacts with another. It differs from traditional linear thinking as there is no one clear path or “solution” in systems thinking, as it focuses on the larger scheme of things and looks at many different paths of action.  

                  Systems-thinking scholar Donella Meadows used a good metaphor in her book Thinking in Systems, when she described the elements of a system as the elements of a tree: roots, trunk, branches, and leaves. These elements are not just sitting in the same place; they play a role with one another and affect one another. </p>
            <h3>Types of Systems </h3>
            <p>   System types classify the nature of the system like natural systems and designed physical systems. Systems engineering can be applied to all types of system. System elements are associated with all system types and help develop and understand them. There are two types of systems: System of interest refers to a system that is under development while an enabling System refers to any System that has an interest in, or interacts with, a System of Interest. When considering any System, or System Element, it is important to understand that they will interact with other System Elements, rather than existing in isolation. In Systems Engineering, everything is connected to something else and so understanding the relationships between System Elements, which form the basis of the interactions between them, is just as important as understanding the System Elements themselves (Holt, 2021). </p>
            <h3>Characteristics of a System </h3>
            <h3>     Stakeholders</h3>
            <p>   Stakeholders define who or what has an interest in the system. They come in many forms and are not always people. Organizations or anything else can also be a stakeholder, they each play a vital role in the system because they each see the system differently. In systems engineering, it is important to identify all stakeholders and their roles. </p>
      
      
            <h3>     Attributes <h3>
            <p>
            Attributes characterize system properties. They can describe the entire system concept, or they can describe other system elements. For example, if the system is a car, attributes could be the fuel type, material, weight, or other dimensions. Each system will have its own unique set of attributes.  </p>
            <h3>     Boundaries <h3>
            <p>   Boundaries define the scope of the system. There are many types of boundaries including the following: 

                  Physical boundaries: An enclosure or barrier that separates the system from the outside work. A car’s outer frame and windows are physical boundaries. A car’s engine block is a physical boundary of the engine which houses all other components.  
   
                   Conceptual boundaries: Abstract or intangible boundaries. The scope of responsibility in a vehicle’s maintenance system is a conceptual boundary. Can it be seen or measured? No. Is there a direct relationship between maintenance and a smooth-running vehicle? Yes. 
   
                   Stakeholder boundaries: The perception of each stakeholder may differ, causing boundaries to change. A passenger might say that the car’s physical boundary is its body. The driver might consider the connection of maintenance and vehicle performance as the boundary. 
   
                   Understanding a system’s boundaries is key. Each interaction across the Boundary of a System is an interface to that System. Identifying interfaces is an important part of Systems Engineering, and a Boundary can be used to identify all interfaces between a System and the outside world. </p>
            <h3>     Needs <h3>
            <p>   
            Needs, simply put, are the purposes of a system. There are different types of needs: requirements, features and goals. Requirements are the desired outcomes the system provides. A car being able to shift gears, stop when the driver presses the brake, and turn are requirements of a vehicle system. Features are needs which surpass just specific functions and describe a broader set of functions working together. In the car example, features could be keyless entry, GPS or Bluetooth connectivity. Goals are an even higher level need which guides the design, development, and evaluation of all features and components in the car system. One goal of an electric car is to minimize environmental impact like carbon emissions, fuel use and pollution (Holt, 2021). </p>
            <h3>     Constraints </h3>
            <p>   Constraints are the limitations that a system must operate within. These can affect how a system is designed, developed, and implemented. Constraints define the boundaries of what is possible or acceptable. They can come from the environment, technical limitations, human factors, or regulations. Consider the car system, an environmental constraint that designers must consider is car must be able to function in extreme weather which affects material and component choices (Holt, 2021). 

               Systems thinking incorporates all the elements and components discussed and focuses on how they interact with each other. It requires a mindset shift: expanding your thinking about what constitutes problem-solving and reframing problem spaces. </p>
            <h3>Systems Engineering </h3>
            <p>According to Holt and Perry, systems engineering can be defined as “a multi-disciplinary, common-sense approach that enables the realization of successful systems (Holt & Perry, 2019). To expand upon that definition, Holt 2021 explains there are a few factors that must be kept in mind: 

               Systems Engineering is a multidisciplinary approach that considers all engineering areas, including mechanical, electrical, civil, software, and so on. Crucially, however, it should also be recognized that Systems Engineering is not just limited to engineering disciplines, but includes many other diverse areas, such as management, mathematics, physics, psychology, and about any other area!  
               
                
               
                Systems Engineering is applied across a system's life cycle and is not restricted to any single stage. This means that Systems Engineering is considered right from the point in time that the very first idea for the System is conceived until the System is retired. Even when working on a single stage, it is important that all stages of the life cycle are considered.  
               
                
               
               Systems Engineering does not remove the need for intelligence, as systems engineers must never blindly follow instructions and require a healthy dose of common sense to be effective. 
               
               Jon Holt emphasizes that systems engineering exists to manage complexity, improve communication, and ensure understanding. If neglected, these three areas lead to major system failures. As systems grow in scale and technological depth, traditional systems engineering becomes more difficult to manage using documents and disconnected tools (Holt, 2021). 
               
               As systems like modern cars evolve to include countless interconnected hardware and software components, the limitations of traditional systems engineering approaches become clear. Managing such complexity demands more than just documents and spreadsheets—it requires a unified, dynamic, and structured way to model the system as a whole. This is where Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) comes into play. </p>
            <h3>Model-Based Systems Engineering </h3> 
            <p>  Since working on my first systems map, I’ve pondered how people can manage and work on these systems given their complexity, and how long it takes to develop a working one. Model Based Systems Engineering or MBSE approach provides the framework that enables the realization of successful systems while managing their complexity and allowing all relevant aspects of the system to be understood in a simple way. 

               Traditional systems engineering is based upon the documents which describe the system. MBSE is based on the model that abstracts the system. Using models is a way of simplifying the system without changing anything, while focusing on only the necessary information that leads to the system’s overall success. Each model is made up of several different views which contain valuable information. What makes the information valuable and therefore necessary? Thinking back to the stakeholders is one way to test this. Earlier I explained how stakeholder’s views are a core principle in systems thinking. MBSE by extension supports this principle by designing models with each stakeholder’s views in mind. For example, a user might be most concerned with usability and accessibility while a manager is concerned about cost efficiency and functionality. MBSE helps streamline the process by gathering multiple different views from the people that matter, right from the start (Holt, 2021). </p>  
            <h3>Why a Model-Based Approach Is Crucial for Complex Digital Systems </h3>
            <p>Digital systems are growing faster than ever before in terms of complexity and structure. They often involve hardware, software, networks, data flows, and user interfaces, all interacting in real time. Managing this complexity using traditional document-based methods just does not work anymore. That is where a model-based approach becomes not just helpful, but necessary. For example, one of the most widely used digital systems is cloud computing. A cloud-based application involves several smaller systems, each running on different servers and sharing data. A model can show how they are connected, what data is exchanged, and where the risks or bottlenecks are (Holt, 2021). 

               Another advantage of the MBSE approach in designing digital systems is engineers can test performance virtually before prototypes are built. This allows issues to be identified early on (Holt, 2021). </p>
            <h3>
               Putting it All Together <h3> 
            <p>In today’s evolving world, the problems we face are no longer simple or isolated, but complex and interconnected. Traditional linear thinking focuses on straight paths, cause-and-effect chains, and isolated components. This approach falls short when applied to complex digital systems where every element is connected, and changes in one part affect it all. 

               Systems thinking offers a more holistic perspective by focusing on relationships, feedback loops, and the synergistic interactions between elements. It encourages us to see the bigger picture, consider multiple viewpoints, and embrace complexity rather than shy away from it. 
               
               Model-Based Systems Engineering is a natural extension of this mindset. Rather than relying only on documents, MBSE uses models that reflect the system’s structure, behavior, and stakeholder needs. It enables engineers and decision-makers to visualize complexity, collaborate effectively, and make smarter choices throughout the system’s lifecycle. 
               
               As digital systems continue to grow in complexity, it is essential for designing systems that are not only functional, but sustainable, adaptable, and aligned with the needs of everyone involved. </p>

               <h1>Module 1.2 Blog Post</h1>
            </header>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
                  <p>Have you ever wondered how apps, software, or even automated checkout systems come to life? These are all results of carefully planned system development processes. We interact with many systems every day in nature, in our homes, in our places of work and in retail stores. Systems are used in many different contexts. So, a system is an interconnecting network of parts that work together thereby creating a larger whole of a complex thing (Das et al., 2022).
                     From your favorite food delivery app to the checkout kiosk at your local grocery store—every digital tool we rely on is part of a broader system. But what does it really mean to develop a system? To understand how these systems are designed, maintained, and evolve over time, we turn to the Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC). </p>
            <h2>Systems Development Lifecycle</h2>
                  <p>The systems development lifecycle is a fundamental process that models how each system behaves throughout various stages. A system is conceived, developed, used, maintained, and eventually retired. The Lifecycle has six stages:</p>   
            <dl>
               <dt>Conception:</dt>
               <dd>
                  What the system needs to do, based on stakeholders needs. Stakeholder input is gathered to define the system’s goals, requirements, and desired outcomes. This is where the "why" of the system is established, often through interviews, surveys, and problem analysis. 
               </dd>
               <dt>Development:</dt>
               <dd>
                  Teams brainstorm, model, and prototype possible solutions, often comparing different technologies or approaches. This stage may involve feasibility studies and early technical design.
               </dd>
               <dt>Production:</dt>
               <dd>
                  Building and testing the actual system for usability. Developers write the code or build the physical components, and QA teams test for functionality, usability, and reliability. 
               </dd>
               <dt>Utilization:</dt>
               <dd>
                  Actively working with the system in a real-world environment. Feedback from real usage is collected, and the system’s performance is monitored to ensure it meets user needs and operational goals.
               </dd>
               <dt>Support:</dt>
               <dd>
                  Keeping the system running smoothly. Maintenance and troubleshooting happen simultaneously with utilization.
               </dd>
               <dt>Retirement:</dt>
               <dd>
                  The system is decommissioned and safely disposed of. This stage includes transferring data if necessary and disposing of or archiving components responsibly. Retirement may also involve transitioning users to a new system.
                  </dd>
            </dl>
            <p>These stages provide a flexible yet structured path to guide system evolution. Not every system follows the same steps in the same order—some stages may overlap, repeat, or be skipped depending on the project’s size and complexity (Holt, 2021). </p>
            <h2>Life Cycle Models</h2>
                  <p>While a life cycle is a structural concept, a life cycle model is described by Holt as “a behavioral construct that describes the execution of a Life Cycle, specifically the order of execution of the stages” (Holt, 2021). Depending on the project, there are a few well established Life Cycle Models that may be used and are described next, with their advantages and possible shortcomings.</p>

               <h3>Linear</h3>
            <p>In a linear model each stage happens right after the next, with a cascading effect. Because of the specific sequence of this model, it is best used for projects where the needs, products and technology involved are not likely to change much. With little variation in the processes in each stage, it is used primarily for well-defined projects with straightforward requirements and tight constraints, such as simple applications with critical, non-negotiable functions. One advantage of Linear models is they are easy to understand and a clear process application. The system is not beneficial for large complex systems where the needs tend to change often. Linear life cycle models are typically not used for systems engineering (Holt, 2021). </p>
               <h3>Iterative</h3>
            <p>The iterative model uses several passes through the stages, or iterations, which break down large complex projects into smaller ones. Think of it as creating a sculpture, the main need is defined then refined through feedback and testing. Each iteration, or pass is a mini life cycle. Because each iteration goes through each stage, they are each workable versions of the final system. This system is beneficial because iterations are shorter and having more versions means more opportunities for improvement. Also, with multiple versions it is easier to restore and find bottlenecks or errors. Iterative systems can produce new versions relatively quickly, an advantage in the software industry. A common example of the iterative model is Agile development, where each sprint produces a working version of the software that incorporates user feedback. According to Jon Holt in Systems Engineering Demystified, “one of the disadvantages of applying an iterative approach to Systems Projects is that the basic needs may be changed quite frequently by Stakeholders, so it is important to have a good, robust needs Process in place, which is often not the case” (Holt, 2021). Iterative models allow space for learning from feedback and evolving understanding of needs. </p>
               <h3>Incremental</h3>
            <p>Incremental and iterative models are sometimes called evolutionary Life Cycle Models because of the multiple passes and releases. In the incremental system, the main focus is adding functionality in smaller increments. This approach allows the project to be built and delivered part by part. The incremental model is like building a house room by room, finishing one before moving on to the next. This method is ideal in complex projects where functionality is needed before the whole project is completed. However not all systems can be worked on or broken down into chunks. For example, some security systems require all components to function together from the beginning, making it harder to implement incrementally (Holt, 2021).</p>
            <h2>Reflection on Systems Thinking </h2> 
                  <p>By viewing development through the lens of systems thinking, we not only build smarter software, but we also build smarter teams, better user experiences, and more adaptable organizations. The Software Development lifecycle that I mentioned earlier is a great example of how systems thinking is utilized in a real-world scenario. It turns an idea into reality and at the end, enables the user to enjoy the intent and presence of an application/product. Although the primary purpose of software development is to serve its users a usable experience, why do so many applications fail to meet customer satisfaction levels? Systems thinking helps us find the reasons and possible routes to better outcomes. </p>
               <h3>Continuous Testing</h3>
            <p>As we saw in the explanations of the three systems lifecycle models, each phase is essential and breaking work into manageable stages like development, testing, and production promotes organized development. The life cycle helps ensure that user needs and goals are clearly defined from the start, and systems thinking includes checks and feedback loops that help catch issues early and improve quality. Thinking ahead through the entire life cycle avoids short-term fixes that create long-term problems.  

               In an example from Systems Thinking, a process for problem solving the author states “It is also necessary to take care how well the flow operates through the system. Doing so enables the teams to remove constraints or bottlenecks in the systems by making them visible with the help of measuring the queue time. Let us take an example, by measuring rate of test case execution or test coverage we can say manual testing would be an obvious constraint in testing phase which will lead to delay in production. The solution could be implementing Continuous Testing that facilitates automated testing, allowing test team to reduce the cycle time in Testing phase” (Das et al., 2022). </p>
               <h3>Adapting to Change</h3> 
            <p>In an IT project lifecycle, user needs increase or change, new technologies and regulations emerge, and systems rarely stay static. A life cycle mindset encourages continuous evaluation and improvement, making it easier to evolve the system without starting over. We saw in the iterative model how useful this method can be for the ever-changing nature of digital systems which must stay relevant, secure, and effective over time. In the workplace, systems thinking also plays a role in productivity and collaboration among teams and projects.</p>   
               <h3>Sustainability</h3>
            <p>The goal should always be envisioning the future and bringing it into being, no matter the complexity of the system, model or framework applied. Sustainable IT practice has emerged as a crucial enabler of environmental stewardship and responsible business practices. A study by Seegrün 2023 and others looks at the development of “Digital Twins, virtual replicas of a product or product-service system, which can be used to provide transparency of a product’s sustainability and to positively influence the ecological impact throughout its lifecycle by means of intelligent data analytics” (Seegrün et al., 2023). For example, in smart manufacturing, a digital twin of a factory floor allows engineers to test energy-saving configurations before applying them in real life, reducing both cost and environmental impact. This unique innovation allows us to simulate and optimize real world scenarios without the cost and waste of physical trial and error. The production and use of digital twins enhance the sustainability of digital systems by enabling smarter design, reducing waste, improving efficiency, and supporting long-term, adaptable solutions. Companies must prepare to take on more responsibility for their products' entire lifecycle, and DTs can increasingly support this responsibility.</p>
            <h2>Final Thought </h2>
                  <p>Understanding the systems' development life cycle and choosing the right model gives us the tools to build better, smarter, and more sustainable digital systems. With the right model and mindset, we can: </p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>Build more user-focused solutions</li>
                     <li>Respond faster to change</li>
                     <li>Design with sustainability in mind</li>
                  </ul> 
            <p>Whether it's through continuous testing, iterative feedback, or innovative tools like digital twins, systems thinking helps us meet the needs of today while preparing for the challenges of tomorrow. </p>
